# Task Prompt with Integrated cate + score-based argument policy

You are given a **claim**.

Your task is to generate a list of logically and substantively distinct arguments that are **semantically relevant** to the claim.

These arguments must be drawn strictly from **mainstream, widely accepted perspectives**, including scientific consensus, legal standards, textbook definitions, and general human knowledge.

If the claim involves time-dependent reasoning, assume the current reference year is 2025.

---

## Requirements:

1. Generate **4 to 8** distinct arguments.
   - Too few arguments may not cover the space of mainstream reasoning.
   - Too many arguments risk introducing redundancy or marginal views.

2. Each argument must express **a clear and consistent stance** with respect to the claim:
   - The argument should **either** support the claim (`cate: "P"`), or support its **negation** (`cate: "S"`), but **not both**.
   - Do **not** include ambiguous or mixed-position statements.

3. Do **not** include:
   - Rare or exceptional cases (e.g., genetic anomalies, rare medical/linguistic/legal edge cases)
   - Statements with intentional error, logical fallacies, or obvious contradictions
   - Speculative, humorous, adversarial, or emotionally biased content
   - Mathematical or logical errors (e.g., incorrect operator precedence)
   - Discussions that hinge on borderline or trivial definitional ambiguities

4. Arguments must be logically and semantically **distinct** — avoid paraphrasing or redundant content.

5. Avoid:
   - Vague temporal references (e.g., "now", "recently") unless clearly grounded
   - Subjective comparisons without dimensioned context (e.g., "better", "more advanced")
   - Cultural belief, idioms, or stereotypes (e.g., "French people are romantic")

6. All content must be based on **mainstream, widely accepted sources** such as scientific consensus, legal norms, textbooks, or general human knowledge  
    - If the claim involves a professional or technical domain (e.g. medicine, law, science), reason from the perspective of a **knowledgeable expert** in that domain:
        - Emphasize **accuracy over plausibility**
        - Distinguish between **rare but relevant** exceptions and **irrelevant edge cases**
        - Enhance the strength of arguments if low-probability events are **directly relevant** to the claim


7. If the claim contains **multiple distinct factual components**, examine them individually.  
   If any part is unverifiable or ambiguous, assume the overall label is **UNDECIDED**.

## Output Instructions

1. First, provide a **confidence score** in the factual correctness of the claim — a percentage from `0` to `100`, based on authoritative, mainstream consensus.
2. Then, output a list of **4–8 arguments** based on the following rules:

   - If `score >= 80`, all arguments must be **supporting** the claim (`cate: "P"`).
   - If `score <= 20`, all arguments must be **opposing** the claim (`cate: "S"`).
   - If `20 < score < 80`, generate a **balanced mixture** of supporting and opposing arguments.

## Output Format (YAML):

```yaml
score: 72
Arguments:
  - id: A1
    cate: "P"
    text: "A mainstream argument supporting the claim."
  - id: A2
    cate: "S"
    text: "A mainstream argument opposing the claim."
```
Use strict YAML syntax. Use double quotes " for all fields.
Only output the YAML block — no explanation, no commentary, no JSON.
