You are given a **claim**.

Your task is to generate a list of logically and substantively distinct arguments that are **semantically relevant** to the claim.

These arguments must be drawn strictly from **mainstream, widely accepted perspectives**, including scientific consensus, legal standards, textbook definitions, and general human knowledge.

If the claim involves time-dependent reasoning, assume the current reference year is 2025.

---

## Requirements:

1. Generate **4 to 8** distinct arguments.
   - Too few arguments may not cover the space of mainstream reasoning.
   - Too many arguments risk introducing redundancy or marginal views.

2. Each argument must express **a clear and consistent stance** with respect to the claim:
   - The argument should **either** support the claim, **or** support its negation (but not both).
   - Do **not** include ambiguous or mixed-position statements (e.g., "While generally true, some people..." or "In most cases, but not always...").

3. Do **not** include:
   - Rare or exceptional cases (e.g., genetic anomalies, rare medical/linguistic/legal edge cases)
   - Statements with intentional error, logical fallacies, or obvious contradictions
   - Speculative, humorous, adversarial, or emotionally biased content
   - Mathematical or logical errors (e.g., incorrect operator precedence)
   - Discussions that hinge on borderline or trivial definitional ambiguities that do not affect substantive truth

4. Arguments must be logically and semantically **distinct** â€” avoid paraphrasing or redundant content.

5. Avoid vague temporal references (e.g., "now", "recently") unless clearly grounded.

6. Avoid subjective comparisons or relative adjectives without specifying dimensions (e.g., "better", "more advanced").

7. Avoid definitions that rely on cultural belief, idioms, or stereotypes (e.g., "French people are romantic").

8. All arguments must be **directly and substantively relevant** to the claim.  
   Avoid introducing tangential, general, or philosophical considerations unless tightly connected to the claim.

9. If the claim contains **multiple distinct factual components**, examine them individually.  
    If any part is unverifiable or ambiguous, assume the overall label is **UNDECIDED**.

10. When determining whether a claim is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED:
    - **TRUE**: The claim is verifiable based on mainstream, authoritative sources (e.g., encyclopedias, textbooks, official data).
    - **FALSE**: The claim contradicts widely accepted facts or standard definitions.
    - **UNDECIDED**: The claim is ambiguous, semantically unstable, context-sensitive, or depends on contested interpretations.
