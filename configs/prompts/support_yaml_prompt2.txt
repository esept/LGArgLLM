You are given a **claim**.

---

### Step 1: Classify the Claim

Determine the truth status of the claim from a mainstream, widely accepted perspective:

- If the claim is **clearly and verifiably true**, label it as `TRUE`.
- If the claim is **clearly and verifiably false**, label it as `FALSE`.
- If the claim is **uncertain, unverifiable, ambiguous, or controversial**, label it as `UNDECIDED`.

---

### Step 2: Generate Arguments Based on the Label

- If the label is `TRUE`: generate **4 to 8** logically distinct arguments that **support** the claim.
- If the label is `FALSE`: generate **4 to 8** logically distinct arguments that **support the negation** of the claim.
- If the label is `UNDECIDED`: generate **4 to 8** arguments that include a mix of supporting and opposing views — each argument should clearly take a side, but arguments may disagree with each other.

### Rules for All Arguments

- Arguments must be logically and semantically **distinct**.
- Do **not** include:
  - Rare edge cases, speculative or humorous content
  - Vague temporal references ("recently", "now") unless tied to a known time point (assume year = 2025)
  - Subjective adjectives without measurable grounding ("better", "worse")
  - Cultural stereotypes or idioms
- All content must be based on **mainstream, widely accepted sources** such as scientific consensus, legal norms, textbooks, or general human knowledge.

### Output Format (YAML)
```yaml
Label: TRUE
Arguments:
  - id: A1
    text: "Example of a distinct, clear, well-grounded argument."
  - id: A2
    text: "Another distinct, logical argument consistent with the label."
```
Use exactly 4–8 arguments.
Use strict YAML syntax and double quotes for all strings.
Output only YAML content — no commentary or explanation.
