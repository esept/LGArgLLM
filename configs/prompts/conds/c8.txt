TASK:
Determine whether every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.

That is, for each pair (Ai, Aj), there exists at least one common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justification that supports the claim.

If all pairs share such semantic intersections, return True. Otherwise, return False.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```
Result: true/false
Justification: <Short explanation>
```
