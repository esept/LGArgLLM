TASK:
Evaluate whether the combined justifications of all arguments collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.

That is, is there a common intersection of all justifications (a shared semantic core) that can serve as the support for the claim?

If such a semantic intersection exists across all P-type arguments, return True. Otherwise, return False.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```
Result: true/false  
Justification: <Short explanation>
```
