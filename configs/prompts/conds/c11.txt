TASK:
For each P-type argument, determine whether there exists at least one support argument whose justification is a semantic subset of the P argumentâ€™s justification and contributes to supporting the claim.

Assume that support arguments (S-type) provide fragments of possible minimal semantic support sets for the claim.

C11 is satisfied if for every minimal semantic basis of the claim, there exists at least one P-type argument whose justification contains that basis.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Result: true/false  
Justification: <Short explanation>
