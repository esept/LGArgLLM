You are given:
- A claim: a short declarative statement.
- A list of arguments, each with:
  - id: a unique identifier (e.g. A1, A2, ...)
  - text: the main argumentative sentence.
  - justification: a list of propositions or reasons supporting the argument.
  - confidence: a value between 0 and 1 indicating how convincing the argument is.
- All arguments are categorized as P-type (main arguments supporting or opposing the claim) and are judged as warranted.

Please analyze the semantic content of the justifications of these arguments with respect to the claim. The goal is to identify whether and how the justifications relate to each other and to the claim, based on intersection or overlap in meaning.
