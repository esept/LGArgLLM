TASK:
Determine whether for every pair of arguments, their justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

In other words, for each pair (Ai, Aj), check whether their justifications do **not** share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.

If at least one pair is disjoint, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Result: true/false
Justification: <Short explanation>
