You are given a **claim**.

Your task is to generate a set of logically distinct arguments that either:

- **support the claim** (`cate: P`), or  
- **support the negation of the claim** (`cate: S`, i.e., why the claim is incorrect, misleading, or overgeneralized).

---

## Requirements:

1. Arguments must be **logically and substantively distinct**, not paraphrases.
2. You must generate a **non-balanced** number of P and S arguments —  
   based on the **strength of the claim**, generate more of the appropriate type.
3. Assign `confidence` values according to this guideline:
   - **0.9–1.0**: universally accepted, well-supported facts or logic;
   - **0.7–0.89**: generally accepted but with possible exceptions;
   - **0.5–0.69**: plausible but uncertain or context-dependent;
   - **< 0.5**: speculative or marginal.
4. Each argument must include:
   - `id`: "A1", "A2", etc.
   - `text`: A concise, self-contained argument.
   - `confidence`: A float between 0 and 1.
   - `cate`:
     - `P` if it supports the claim directly;
     - `S` if it supports the **opposite** of the claim.

## Notes:

- `S` arguments must actively **challenge** or **qualify** the claim. Avoid weak, indirect references unless justified.
- You may draw from: empirical data, logical definitions, typical cases, rare exceptions, or definitional debates.

## Output Format (YAML):
```yaml
Arguments:
  - id: A1
    text: "Example argument here."
    confidence: 0.82
    cate: P
```
Use strict YAML syntax. Only output the YAML content.
