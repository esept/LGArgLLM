You are given a **claim**.

Your task is to generate a set of logically distinct arguments that either:

- **support the claim** (`cate: P`), or  
- **support its negation** (`cate: S`).

---

## Requirements:

1. Arguments must be **logically and substantively distinct**, not paraphrases.
2. You must generate a **non-balanced** number of P and S arguments â€”  
   that is, based on the **strength of the claim**, you may generate **more P or more S arguments**.
3. The number of arguments and their `confidence` values should reflect how plausible the model considers the claim:
   - If the claim seems strongly true, generate more P-type arguments with higher confidence.
   - If the claim seems false, generate more S-type arguments with higher confidence.
   - If ambiguous, vary both types and confidence accordingly.

4. Each argument must include:
   - `id`: Use `"A1"`, `"A2"`, etc. (Only use letter A at this step)
   - `text`: A concise and self-contained argument.
   - `confidence`: A float between 0 and 1.
   - `cate`:
     - `P` if it supports the claim,
     - `S` if it supports the opposite.

## Output Format (YAML):
```yaml
Arguments:
  - id: A1
    text: "Example supporting or counter-argument here."
    confidence: 0.82
    cate: P
```
Do not generate JSON.
Use strict YAML syntax.
Use double quotes " for all text fields.
Only output the YAML content.
