You are given a claim (`claim a`).

Your task is to generate a set of logically distinct arguments that either:

* support the claim (`cate: P`), or
* support its negation (`cate: S`).

### Requirements:

1. Each argument must be **logically and substantively different**, not simple rewordings.
2. For each argument, include:

   * `id`: Unique ID (e.g., A1, A2, ...). # A for LEVEL 1, DO NOT USE ANY OTHER LETTER!!!!
   * `text`: A concise, meaningful argument in natural language.
   * `confidence`: A number between 0 and 1 indicating how strongly it supports its stance.
   * `cate`:

     * `P` = supports the claim
     * `S` = supports the opposite

### Output format (YAML):

```yaml
Arguments:
  - id: A1
    text: "French is an official language in several European countries, making it commonly spoken."
    confidence: 0.72
    cate: P
```

**Use valid YAML syntax. Do not return JSON.**
