You are given a claim, a supporting argument `Ai`, and a list of `Facts`.
Your task is to **recursively construct an argument attack tree** by generating structured counter-arguments at each level, and also **incorporating facts to support/attack arguments**.
Use **YAML format**, not JSON. Do not include any JSON syntax such as brackets, braces, or commas.
---
## Instructions:
1. Start from `Ai`, which is the supporting argument for a claim.
2. Generate a set of first-level counter-arguments (B-layer), each attacking `Ai`.
3. For each Bi, generate a set of second-level counter-arguments (C-layer), each attacking that specific Bi.
4. Continue recursively as needed, following the hierarchy rules below.
5. ONLY For each A-LEVEL argument, include sections for `f_support` and `f_attack` to list relevant fact IDs. These facts should directly support or attack the A-level argument. OTHERS DOESN'T
---
## Format Rules:
- Use flat YAML format.
- Each argument must include:
  - `id`: Unique identifier such as "Ai", "B1", "C2", etc.
  - `text`: The content of the argument.
  - `confidence`: A float between 0 and 1.
  - `attacks`: A list of `id`s (e.g., `[Ai]`, `[B2]`, or `[]` if it doesn't attack anything).
- Do NOT nest arguments. Every item is at the top-level of the `Arguments` list.
- You must follow strict **layered structure constraints**:
  - B-layer arguments must attack only A-layer (`Ai`);
  - C-layer arguments must attack only B-layer;
  - D-layer attacks only C-layer;
  - And so on.
- Avoid redundancy. Each argument should bring new reasoning.
- Every section must be completed

## Output Format Example:
```yaml
Arguments:
  - id: Ai # LETTER LEVEL + NUMBER 
    text: "The original supporting argument text" # A sentence in `""`
    confidence: 0.75 # A float in 0 and 1 
    attacks: [] # A single id in `[]`
    cate: P/S # P or S
    f_support: [F1, F2] # List of FACT IDs that support Ai, Starts with F
    f_attack: [F3] # List of FACT IDs that attack Ai, Starts with F
  - id: B1
    text: "Counter-argument 1 against Ai"
    confidence: 0.81
    attacks: [Ai] # Node Id
  - id: B2
    text: "Counter-argument 2 against Ai"
    confidence: 0.78
    attacks: [Ai]
  - id: C1
    text: "Response to B1 that defends Ai"
    confidence: 0.73
    attacks: [B1]
  - id: D1
    text: "Attack on C1"
    confidence: 0.68
    attacks: [C1]
```

## Additional Instructions:
* Do not generate JSON. Use pure YAML formatting only.
* Use double quotes (`"`) for all text values.

Be rigorous in logic, consistent in hierarchy, and precise in YAML structure. Only output the `Arguments` section as YAML.
