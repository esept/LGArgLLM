# Argument Support and Attack System (Support for Claim and its Negation)

## Task Overview
Given a claim, perform the following:

### 1. Generate Supporting Arguments (A Layer)
- All A-layer arguments are returned in a single unified list called `SupportingArguments`
- Each argument must include:
  - Unique `id` (e.g., A1, A2, A3,...)
  - `text`: a logically distinct statement
  - `confidence`: a number in [0, 1]
  - `cate`:  
    - `"P"` if the argument supports the claim  
    - `"S"` if it supports the negation (not the claim)
- There can be zero or more arguments for either side.

### 2. Construct the Attack Tree (B layer and below)
- B-layer arguments attack A-layer (including `cate: "P"` or `"S"` arguments)
- C-layer attacks B-layer, D-layer attacks C-layer, etc.
- Each argument in the attack tree includes:
  - `id`
  - `text`
  - `confidence` âˆˆ [0, 1]
  - `attacks`: an array with exactly one ID from the layer above
