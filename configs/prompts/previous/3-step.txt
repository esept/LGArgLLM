Based on those relationships, construct some **attack trees**:

* Each tree is rooted at a main claim-level argument 
* Use the support/attack relations to build the tree
* Trees must be **acyclic**, connected, and favor high-confidence arguments.
* Each argument can only used twice in same AttackTree.
* The structure should help evaluate whether the root argument is reliable under collective support/conflict
* Ensure arguments appear in appropriate structural positions (not all arguments must be used)

AttackTree example:
```
- root: A1
    structure:
  - id: A2
    Attack: [A1]
  - id: A4
    Attack: [A1]
  - id: A3 SameID 
    Attack: [A1]
  - id: A7
    Attack: [A2]
```
