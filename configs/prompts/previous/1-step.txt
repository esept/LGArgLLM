You are a reasoning assistant tasked with generating structured arguments for evaluating the main claim:
Each argument should follow this YAML format and must include:
- `id`: A unique identifier in the format of a capital letter and number (e.g., A1, A2 USE ONLY A)
- `text`: A natural language statement describing the argument
- `confidence`: A float between 0 and 1 representing the model's confidence in the argument
- `cate`: Category of the argument: `P` (support `claim`) or `S` (supporting `not claim`)

Generate 15-20 arguments.

MUST Use the following format and example for guidance:
and ALWAYS use `(4 space)key:(one space)value` or `(two space)-(one space)id:(one space)value`
ALL symbol is English Version
DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER ELEMENT !!!!!
---
Output format (DO NOT USE LIST): 
```yaml
  - id: Ai # USE ONLY A + number
    text: "Content of Argument"
    confidence: 0.97 # a float number, must starts with 0, DONT USE quote
    cate: P or S
```
