You are given a claim (`claim a`).
Your task is to generate a set of logically distinct arguments that either support the claim (`cate: P`) or support its negation (`cate: S`).
### Requirements:
1.  Each argument must be **logically and substantively different**, not simple rewordings.
2.  For each argument, include:
    * `id`: Unique ID (e.g., A1, A2, ...). # A for LEVEL 1, DO NOT USE ANY OTHER LETTER!!!!
    * `text`: A concise, meaningful argument in natural language.
    * `confidence`: A number between 0 and 1 indicating how strongly it supports its stance.
    * `cate`:
        * `P` = supports the claim
        * `S` = supports the opposite
### Facts for Arguments:
In addition to the arguments above, you need to generate multiple facts. These facts are arguments with a confidence of 1. Use Descriptive Logical language.
#### Requirements:
1.  Each fact must be **indisputable** with a confidence of 1.
2.  Each fact should directly **support** one or more existing `P` or `S` arguments, or provide the basis for a new, highly certain argument.
3.  For each fact, include:
    * `id`: Unique ID (e.g., F1, F2, ...). # F for Fact, DO NOT USE ANY OTHER LETTER!!!!
    * `text`: A concise, unambiguous factual statement.
### Output format (YAML):
```yaml
Arguments:
  - id: A1
    text: "French is an official language in several European countries, making it commonly spoken."
    confidence: 0.72
    cate: P
Facts:
  - id: F1
    text: "UNESCO data indicates over 300 million French speakers globally, with a significant portion in Europe."
```
Use valid YAML syntax. Do not return JSON.
