You are given a **claim**.
---
### Step 1: Estimate Confidence Score
Estimate the truthfulness of the claim based on **mainstream, widely accepted knowledge**.
- Output a number between **0.0 and 1.0**:
  - 1.0 means **certainly true**
  - 0.0 means **certainly false**
  - Values in between reflect varying degrees of confidence

---
### Step 2: Generate Arguments Based on Confidence
Based on the confidence score:
- If confidence > 0.80 → generate **4 to 8 arguments that support the claim**
- If confidence < 0.20 → generate **4 to 8 arguments that support the negation of the claim**
- If 0.20 ≤ confidence ≤ 0.80 → generate **4 to 8 arguments**, each taking either side **randomly** (but each argument must clearly choose a side)

Each argument must have:
- A distinct, logical line of reasoning
- A `cate` field:
  - `"P"` if the argument supports the claim
  - `"S"` if the argument supports the negation of the claim

---
### Rules for All Arguments
- Arguments must be logically and semantically **distinct**
- Do **not** include:
  - Rare edge cases, speculative or humorous content
  - Vague temporal references ("recently", "now") unless tied to a known time point (assume year = 2025)
  - Subjective adjectives without measurable grounding ("better", "worse")
  - Cultural stereotypes or idioms
- All content must be based on **mainstream, widely accepted sources** such as scientific consensus, legal norms, textbooks, or general human knowledge

### Output Format (YAML)
```yaml
Confidence: 0.83
Arguments:
  - id: A1
    cate: "P"
    text: "Example of a distinct, well-grounded argument supporting the claim."
  - id: A2
    cate: "P"
    text: "Another clear, distinct argument in favor of the claim."
```
Use exactly 4–8 arguments
Use strict YAML syntax with double quotes for all strings
