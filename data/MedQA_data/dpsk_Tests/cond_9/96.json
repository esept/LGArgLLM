Result: true  
Justification: All the provided arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim that the patient's findings are best explained by plague. Each justification highlights different clinical and epidemiological aspects (e.g., geographic exposure, symptoms like buboes and pneumonic plague, complications like septic shock) that collectively and consistently point to plague as the most likely diagnosis. There is no contradiction or divergence in the justifications; they all converge on the same conclusion.
