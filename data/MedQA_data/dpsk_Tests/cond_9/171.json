Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim that Turner syndrome is likely the condition affecting the patient. While both arguments mention aspects of Turner syndrome (cardiovascular abnormalities and late diagnosis), they do not intersect in a way that collectively supports the claim based on the patient's specific symptoms and background information. The arguments are related to Turner syndrome but do not form a unified or overlapping basis for the claim.
