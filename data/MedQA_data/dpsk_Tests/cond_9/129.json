Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the claim. They collectively support the idea that the patient's symptoms are due to a temporary sciatic nerve injury caused by improper vaccine injection in the buttock. The justifications mention consistent symptoms (Trendelenburg sign), plausible timing, absence of alternative complications, and alignment with pediatric vaccination guidelines warning against buttock injections. This forms a coherent and intersecting basis for the claim.
