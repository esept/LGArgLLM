Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim that a CT angiogram is the best next step in management. The justifications consistently highlight the patient's high risk for stroke due to her symptoms (TIA), history of atrial fibrillation, elevated blood pressure, and multiple vascular risk factors. They all emphasize the necessity of vascular imaging (CT angiogram) to assess for underlying cerebrovascular pathology, such as large vessel occlusion, stenosis, or atherosclerosis, which is critical for preventing a subsequent stroke. This shared reasoning forms a cohesive basis for the claim.
