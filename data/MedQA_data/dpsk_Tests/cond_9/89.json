Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification suggests the insulin dose may be too high, the second recommends investigating before making dose reductions, and the third suggests reducing evening insulin dose could help. These justifications do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim that reducing daily insulin dose is the optimal intervention.
