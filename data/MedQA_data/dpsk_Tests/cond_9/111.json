Result: true  
Justification: All the provided arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim of effect modification. Each argument highlights how the CD4+ count modifies the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk, either through statistical significance, differing risk ratios, biological plausibility, or alignment with the definition of effect modification. The justifications collectively reinforce the same underlying reasoning for the claim.
