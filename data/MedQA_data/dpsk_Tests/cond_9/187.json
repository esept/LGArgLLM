Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They all focus on the long-term consequences of a shattered calcaneus and its surgical repair, specifically highlighting chronic pain during inversion and eversion of the foot due to altered biomechanics, surgical intervention, and the severity of the injury. This consistent theme across all arguments establishes a unified basis for the claim.
