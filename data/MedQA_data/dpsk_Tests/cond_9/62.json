Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments suggest hyperestrinism contributes to lower limb swelling (e.g., via peripheral vasodilation or fluid retention), others explicitly state that hyperestrinism is not the primary cause (e.g., citing portal hypertension and hypoalbuminemia as the main factors). Thus, there is no intersection of all justifications supporting the claim.
