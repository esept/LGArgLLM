Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The justifications consistently emphasize the patient's symptoms and clinical findings (e.g., fever, vomiting, adnexal mass, cervical motion tenderness) as indicative of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) requiring inpatient treatment with intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline. They also uniformly highlight the severity of symptoms, risk factors (sexual history, recent antibiotic use), and the need for broad-spectrum coverage to prevent complications. Thus, the justifications collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
