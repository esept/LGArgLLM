Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments support the low dose dexamethasone suppression test as the next step (confirming Cushing's syndrome or ACTH-independent hypercortisolism), others argue for proceeding directly to imaging (adrenal CT or MRI) instead. These justifications present divergent management strategies rather than a unified semantic basis for the claim.
