Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments suggest that Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is likely absent due to glycolytic activity and downregulation of mitochondrial enzymes, while others argue that it is typically present in all human cells with functional mitochondria or that its absence cannot be assumed without direct evidence. The lack of a consistent semantic intersection across all justifications means they do not collectively support the same basis for the claim.
