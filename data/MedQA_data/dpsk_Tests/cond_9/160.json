Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments support the claim by linking the rash to cytotoxic T-cell destruction due to ceftriaxone, others suggest alternative causes (e.g., contact dermatitis or viral exanthems) or question the timing of the reaction, which is inconsistent with cytotoxic T-cell mechanisms. There is no single shared semantic basis across all justifications.
