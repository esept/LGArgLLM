Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications provided for the P-type arguments consistently point to alcohol use disorder as the underlying cause of the patient's condition. They highlight specific clinical and neuroimaging findings (e.g., MRI findings of anterior thalamic and mamillary body atrophy, confabulation, memory deficits pattern) that are classic for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is strongly associated with chronic alcohol use. There is a shared semantic core across all justifications supporting alcohol use disorder as the most likely predisposing factor.
