Result: true  
Justification: All the provided arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently highlight the need for an X-ray due to the presence of leg deformities, family history of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), and the clinical finding of genu varum. They also emphasize that X-ray is the standard diagnostic tool for such conditions and that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing long-term complications. This shared reasoning forms a unified basis for the claim that an X-ray of the lower extremities is the most appropriate next step in management.
