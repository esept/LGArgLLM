Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that describes chlorhexidine's mechanism of action as being pH-dependent and reduced in the presence of organic matter. Each justification emphasizes this dual aspect (pH sensitivity and organic matter interference) as key to chlorhexidine's antimicrobial efficacy, thus collectively supporting the claim.
