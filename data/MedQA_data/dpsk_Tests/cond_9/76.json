Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While most arguments (A1, A2, A3, A5) argue against increased BNP secretion due to hypovolemia and lack of ventricular stretch, one argument (A4) suggests a possible scenario where BNP secretion could increase if there is underlying cardiac dysfunction. This creates a semantic divergence rather than a shared intersection.
