Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that links the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be prevented or treated with B12 injections. The justifications collectively support the claim by highlighting different manifestations (oral, hematologic, dermatologic, and familial) of B12 deficiency, all of which would be addressed by B12 supplementation.
