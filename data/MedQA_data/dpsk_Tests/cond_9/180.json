Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first two justifications support the use of selective alpha-1 agonists for nasal congestion due to viral infections, while the third justification introduces a different cause (non-viral factors) that may not require the same treatment. There is no intersection in meaning across all justifications that uniformly supports the claim.
