Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument suggests herpes zoster (shingles) as the likely diagnosis, which contradicts the claim of a bacterial lymphatic infection. The second argument reduces the likelihood of a bacterial infection but does not provide a common basis for the claim. Therefore, there is no shared semantic intersection supporting the claim.
