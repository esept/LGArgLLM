Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first two arguments argue against aortic regurgitation, suggesting other conditions (ankylosing spondylitis or reactive arthritis) are more likely, while the third argument provides a weak theoretical link between aortic regurgitation and ankylosing spondylitis. There is no consistent support for the claim across all justifications.
