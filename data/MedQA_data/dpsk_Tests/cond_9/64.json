Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core, which is the alignment of each child's developmental milestones and behaviors with typical age-appropriate norms (1 month, 4 months, and 9 months). Each justification supports the claim by linking specific observed behaviors or milestones to the expected developmental stages of the respective ages, thus collectively reinforcing the same semantic basis for the claim.
