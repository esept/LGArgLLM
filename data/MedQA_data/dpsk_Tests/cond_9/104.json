Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim of a 20% ejection fraction. The first justification mentions that the findings are not diagnostic, the second links the patient's history to the claim without direct evidence, and the third suggests severe systolic dysfunction but does not conclusively establish a 20% ejection fraction. There is no single, shared semantic basis across all justifications that supports the claim.
