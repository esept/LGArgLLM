Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that decreasing sodium intake is the most likely intervention. While some arguments support sodium reduction (e.g., decreasing urinary calcium excretion, hypercalciuria risk), others advocate for different primary interventions (e.g., increasing fluid intake, oxalate restriction, calcium intake modulation). The justifications are not unified in supporting sodium reduction as the most likely intervention.
