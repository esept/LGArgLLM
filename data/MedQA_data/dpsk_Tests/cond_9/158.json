Result: true  
Justification: All the P-type arguments share a common semantic core that links the patient's symptoms and findings to celiac disease, which is managed with a gluten-free diet. The justifications consistently mention symptoms (mouth ulcers, swollen tongue), laboratory findings (macrocytic anemia), and family history that align with celiac disease, all of which would be addressed by a gluten-free diet. Thus, there is a shared semantic basis supporting the claim.
