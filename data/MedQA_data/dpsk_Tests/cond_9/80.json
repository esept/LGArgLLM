Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the P-type arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first two arguments suggest that gag gene mutations could explain the lack of responsiveness to therapy, while the third argument contradicts this by stating the symptoms are more consistent with an opportunistic infection. There is no intersection in meaning across all justifications.
