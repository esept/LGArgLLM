Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first argument states that exploratory laparoscopy is indicated for non-palpable testes to locate and potentially retrieve the undescended testicle, which aligns with standard urological practice. The second argument adds that laparoscopy can help determine if the other testicle is intra-abdominal, which is a common location for undescended testes. Both justifications focus on the use of laparoscopy to locate and manage undescended testes, thus supporting the same semantic basis for the claim.
