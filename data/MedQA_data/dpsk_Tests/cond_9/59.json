Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim of defective T cell function. Each justification highlights different clinical manifestations (persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, RSV pneumonia, failure to thrive) and links them to T-cell immunodeficiency, particularly severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The arguments collectively emphasize the role of T cells in immune defense and rule out HIV as a cause, reinforcing the shared conclusion of defective T cell function.
