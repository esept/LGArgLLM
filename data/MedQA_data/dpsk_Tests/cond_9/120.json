Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While the first two justifications mention genotyping as part of confirmatory tests, the third justification explicitly states that the primary purpose of a confirmatory test is to verify the presence of the virus, not necessarily to determine its genotype. This contradiction means there is no shared semantic basis across all justifications.
