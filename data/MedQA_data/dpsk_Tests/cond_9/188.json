Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments support the claim by pointing out classic signs of acute dystonia and its association with haloperidol, another argument contradicts this by stating that the symptoms developed slowly over 2 weeks, which is atypical for acute dystonia. This lack of consensus means there is no shared semantic basis across all justifications.
