Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments suggest muscarinic antagonists could be effective (e.g., relieving bronchoconstriction, adjunctive therapy in allergic asthma), others contradict this (e.g., less effective as monotherapy, primary treatment should be corticosteroids/beta-agonists). There is no consistent intersection in meaning across all justifications.
