Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments support cladribine as the most effective treatment (e.g., high response rates, single-course administration), others mention alternative treatments like rituximab and interferon-alpha, or complications like the unsuccessful bone marrow aspiration. These justifications do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
