Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments support hysteroscopy for visualizing the uterine cavity or diagnosing/treating intrauterine pathology, another argument contradicts this by suggesting laparoscopy is more appropriate for evaluating endometriosis, which it considers a more likely cause of the symptoms. This lack of agreement means there is no shared semantic basis across all justifications.
