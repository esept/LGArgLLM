Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. One argument suggests an infectious cause (surgical site infection or urinary tract infection) as more likely, while the other acknowledges the possibility of a transfusion reaction but notes the absence of other symptoms. These justifications do not intersect in meaning to collectively support the claim that a transfusion reaction is the most likely cause.
