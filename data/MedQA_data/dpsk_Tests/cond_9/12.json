Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification emphasizes the diagnostic utility of a contrast enema in identifying mechanical obstruction or Hirschsprung disease, given the patient's symptoms (delayed meconium passage, abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds) and risk factors (Ashkenazi Jewish descent). The arguments collectively reinforce the necessity of a contrast enema as the best next step in management.
