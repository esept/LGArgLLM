Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that interviewer bias is the most likely type of bias. Some arguments suggest interviewer bias is possible (e.g., interpretation by interviewers), while others argue it is less likely (e.g., high response rate, robust study design, potential blind administration). There is no intersection in meaning that uniformly supports the claim.
