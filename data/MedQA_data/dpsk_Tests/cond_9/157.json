Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that hemoptysis would be the most concerning development. Some arguments suggest hemoptysis is a serious concern (e.g., indicating pulmonary edema or hemorrhage), while others argue that other complications (e.g., cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation) are more concerning. There is no intersection of all justifications supporting the claim.
