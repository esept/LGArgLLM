Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim of a vaginal septum. Instead, they argue against it by pointing to normal pubertal progression, lack of evidence for structural abnormalities, and suggesting alternative diagnoses like hypothalamic amenorrhea. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
