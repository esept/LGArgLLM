Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that the patient's symptoms and history are consistent with botulism, and atropine is part of the standard treatment for botulism to manage autonomic dysfunction or parasympathetic overactivity. This shared basis supports the claim that atropine is the best treatment for this patient.
