Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core, which is the association of the observed fetal anomalies (microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, VSD, and polyhydramnios) with Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), a condition known to include a prominent occiput as a characteristic feature. Each justification reinforces this connection, making the collective support for the claim consistent and unified.
