Result: true  
Justification: Both justifications focus on the interaction between omeprazole and bupropion, specifically how omeprazole affects the absorption and metabolism of bupropion. The first justification explains the mechanism (increased gastric pH affecting bupropion), while the second provides a practical recommendation (timing of administration to mitigate the interaction). Both support the claim's core idea about the interaction and timing of medication use.
