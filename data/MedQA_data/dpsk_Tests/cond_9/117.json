Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Each justification refers to the mechanism of action of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as irreversible inhibitors of H+/K+-ATPase in parietal cells, their superiority over H2 blockers like cimetidine, and their role as first-line treatment for GERD when symptoms are not controlled by H2 blockers. This consistent overlap in meaning confirms a shared semantic basis for the claim.
