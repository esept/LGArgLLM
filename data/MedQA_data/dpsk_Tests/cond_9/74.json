Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim about the proliferation of endometrial glands. While some arguments (e.g., nulliparity, late menopause, postmenopausal bleeding) support the claim, others (e.g., ascites suggesting ovarian cancer) contradict or do not directly support it. There is no intersection in meaning across all justifications that uniformly supports the claim.
