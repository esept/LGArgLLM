Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that the most likely underlying cause is an adverse effect of anesthetic. Instead, both arguments suggest alternative explanations (transfusion-associated viral hepatitis and other viral causes) that contradict the claim. Therefore, there is no intersection of justifications supporting the claim.
