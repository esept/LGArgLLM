Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument states that the antibodies bind to hemidesmosomes, not gap junctions, while the second argument explains that gap junctions are not the target of IgG antibodies in autoimmune blistering disorders. Both arguments contradict the claim rather than supporting it.
