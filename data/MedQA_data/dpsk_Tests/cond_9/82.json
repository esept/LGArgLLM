Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument points to hepatic encephalopathy as the likely cause of the patient's condition, while the second acknowledges the presence of gastric varices but notes no active bleeding. These justifications do not collectively support variceal gastrointestinal bleeding as the precipitating factor.
