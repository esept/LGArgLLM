Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments provide justifications that align with the symptoms and laboratory findings described in the claim, specifically pointing to VIPoma as the likely diagnosis. The first justification highlights classic symptoms of VIPoma (facial flushing, weakness, chronic diarrhea, hypercalcemia), while the second justification focuses on the electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia and hypercalcemia) that are consistent with VIPoma. Both justifications support the same semantic basis for the claim, which is the diagnosis of VIPoma based on the patient's presentation.
