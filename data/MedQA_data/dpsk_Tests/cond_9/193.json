Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core: Bupropion should be avoided in this patient due to the increased risk of seizures associated with a history of eating disorders (specifically binge eating and purging behavior). Each justification reinforces this point, either by citing contraindications, clinical guidelines, or the availability of safer alternatives.
