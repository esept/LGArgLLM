Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. Some arguments support the claim by stating that the observed changes are consistent with hyperplasia (e.g., hormonal changes stimulating epithelial proliferation), while others argue against it by distinguishing hyperplasia as a pathological condition from the normal physiological changes in pregnancy. There is no intersection in meaning that uniformly supports the claim.
