Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments explicitly link the man's behavior to reaction formation (e.g., expressing opposite feelings, psychological conflict), others propose alternative explanations (e.g., social conformity, internalized homophobia) that do not align with the defense mechanism. The lack of a consistent semantic intersection across all arguments means they do not collectively support the same basis for the claim.
