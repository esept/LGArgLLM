Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two P-type arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification points to carcinoid syndrome and neuroendocrine tumors, while the second suggests a catecholamine-secreting tumor like a pheochromocytoma. These are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic implications, so there is no shared semantic basis supporting the claim.
