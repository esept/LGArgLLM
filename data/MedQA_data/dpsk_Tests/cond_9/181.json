Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on the need for ampicillin due to the risk of GBS infection in PPROM, while the second justification discusses the general need for interventions like antibiotics and progesterone to delay delivery at 32 weeks. There is no overlapping semantic basis that ties both justifications together to support the claim.
