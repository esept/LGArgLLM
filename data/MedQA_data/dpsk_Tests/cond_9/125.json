Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments (A1, A2, A4) support the use of ceftriaxone for treating potential SBP in cirrhotic patients, argument A3 suggests addressing hypoglycemia first, which diverges from the shared focus on infection/SBP. Thus, there is no intersection of all justifications supporting the claim.
