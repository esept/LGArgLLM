Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification points to evidence (clinical presentation, pulmonary function test, physical examination, chest X-ray, and smoking history) that collectively indicates COPD as the underlying condition, which is strongly associated with respiratory acidosis. The justifications consistently reinforce the same diagnosis and expected arterial blood gas findings.
