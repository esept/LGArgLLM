  "claim": "Consider the following background information: Thirty minutes after delivery, a 3600-g (7-lb 15-oz) newborn has noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of her lips, and intermittent respiratory distress. She was born at 38 weeks\" gestation and required bag-mask resuscitation immediately after delivery. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. Her mother has noticed the bluish lip discoloration worsen when she fed and improve when she cried. The patient\"s pulse is 163/min, respirations are 62/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. The crying infant\"s lungs are clear to auscultation.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show the presence of a scaphoid abdomen.",
