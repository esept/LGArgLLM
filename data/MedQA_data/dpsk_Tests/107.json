  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 31-year-old female patient complains of numbness and tingling in her left hand, weakness, difficulty with walking, dizziness, and bladder dysfunction. She said that about a year ago, she had trouble with her vision, and that it eventually recovered in a few days. On physical exam, bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hyperreflexia in both patella, and bilateral clonus, are noted. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was done (Figure 1).\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: If a lumbar puncture is performed in this patient, albuminocytologic dissociation would most likely be found in the cerebrospinal fluid analysis.",
