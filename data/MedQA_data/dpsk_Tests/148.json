  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 45-year-old homeless man comes to the emergency department because of progressive neck pain for 3 days. He also reports headaches and numbness in both hands. Over the past 4 months, he has had intermittent lower back pain after waking up. The back pain improves with movement. He also has recurrent episodes of gout in the metatarsophalangeal joint of his right big toe. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks four beers daily. The patient is a known user of intravenous heroin. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. There are several track marks on both forearms. Examination of the neck shows warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion. Gentle palpation over the midcervical spinal processes causes severe pain. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 11 g/dL Leukocyte count 14,200/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 77% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 20% Monocytes 2% Platelet count 278,000/mm3 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 54 mm/h Blood cultures are pending. An x-ray of the cervical spine shows no abnormalities. An MRI of the spine shows signs of inflammation. A bone biopsy confirms the diagnosis.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Bone scintigraphy is the most appropriate next step in management.",
