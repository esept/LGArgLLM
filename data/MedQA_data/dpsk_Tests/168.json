  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 27-year-old woman with no past medical history presents to the emergency department with recurrent wrist and neck pain for the last 2 months. She reports that her fingers feel stiff in the morning and the symptoms tend to improve as the day progresses. She denies any recent trauma or other inciting events. Family history is significant for a grandmother who suffered from fibromyalgia. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 16/min, and heart rate is 70/min. On physical examination, her metacarpophalangeal joints are erythematous and tender.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Synovial fluid analysis would be most helpful for diagnosing this patient\"s condition.",
