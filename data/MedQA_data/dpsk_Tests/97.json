  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent \u201cwetting myself.\u201d She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she \u201cneeds to focus.\u201d The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Urethral hypermobility is the most likely cause of the patient\"s symptoms.",
