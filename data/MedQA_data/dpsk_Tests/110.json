  "claim": "Consider the following background information: Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle in humans. This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation are expected to have an increased muscle relaxation time and an increased cytosolic calcium concentration.",
