She has a past medical history of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis. Her hematocrit is 29%. On peripheral blood smear, you notice neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells. On physical exam, you notice the patient has decreased position sense and a loss in vibratory sensation in her lower extremities.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Atrophy of G cells is most likely present in this patient.",
