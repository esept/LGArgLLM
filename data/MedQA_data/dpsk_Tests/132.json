He is growing along with the 75th percentile and meeting all milestones. Physical examination shows a poorly rugated scrotum. The palpation of the scrotum shows only 1 testicle. A 2nd testicle is palpated in the inguinal canal. The examination of the penis shows a normal urethral meatus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Exploratory laparoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management.",
