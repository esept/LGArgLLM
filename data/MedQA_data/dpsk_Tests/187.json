Paramedics arrive quickly, and he is taken to the hospital where several stable lumbar fractures and a shattered right calcaneus are found. He undergoes surgery and his calcaneus is repaired with 11 screws.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient is expected to experience pain with inversion and eversion of his foot during the long-term post-surgery period.",
