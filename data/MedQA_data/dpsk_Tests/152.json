  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 23-year-old college student presents to the clinic with a history of intermittent chest discomfort. He reports that, about once per month for the past 8 or 9 months, he\"s had episodes of \"feeling like my chest is going to explode.\" During these episodes, he also feels shortness of breath, feels shakiness throughout his arms and legs, and sweats so heavily that he needs to change his shirt. He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Lorazepam is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient\"s condition.",
