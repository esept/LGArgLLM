The concentration of glutamate in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy after Schaffer collateral fibers are electrically stimulated.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The accumulation of cAMP most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters.",
