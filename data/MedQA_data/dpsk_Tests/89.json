He complains of frequent episodes of waking up in the middle of his sleep. When he wakes up, he feels excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. His morning blood glucose is high on repeated measurement.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Reducing daily insulin dose is the optimal intervention for this patient condition.",
