  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient\u2019s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient\u2019s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a \"clunk\" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Rheumatoid arthritis is the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition.",
