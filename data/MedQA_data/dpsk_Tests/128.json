  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 45-year-old G3P3 presents complaining of the feeling of a foreign body in her vagina that worsens on standing. She does not have urinary or fecal incontinence or any other genitourinary symptoms. She has no known gynecologic diseases. There were no complications with her pregnancies, all of which were full-term vaginal deliveries. She is sexually active with her husband and no longer uses oral contraceptives. She has an 11 pack-year history of smoking. Her weight is 79 kg (174 lb) and her height is 155 cm (5 ft). Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination is unremarkable. The gynecologic examination reveals descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus. On Valsalva and standing, the cervix descents to the plane of the hymen. The uterus is not enlarged and the ovaries are non-palpable.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: A space-filling pessary is the most reasonable treatment to offer this patient.",
