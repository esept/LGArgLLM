  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 38-year-old nursing home worker presents to the clinic with complaints of fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, and productive cough for the past couple of months. His fever is low-grade and sputum is often blood-tinged. He has lost 6.8 kg (15.0 lb) during this period and complains of profound night sweats. A plain radiograph of the patient\u2019s chest shows consolidation in the apical part of the right lung. Baseline investigations show the following: Complete blood count Hemoglobin 11 g/dL White blood cells   Total count 16,000/mm3 Differential count   Neutrophils 35% Lymphocytes 54% Eosinophils 11% Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 84 mm The physician suspects that the patient is suffering from a chronic lung infection.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The type of the patient\"s lung inflammation is best described as consisting of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells and Langhans cells.",
