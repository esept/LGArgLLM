  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Decreasing sodium intake is the most likely intervention to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient.",
