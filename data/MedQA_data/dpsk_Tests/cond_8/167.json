Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the role of the spleen's white pulp (zone 3) in immune defense against encapsulated bacteria, which is central to the claim. The first argument directly describes the function of zone 3, the second links sickle-cell disease to dysfunction in zone 3, and the third connects the clinical practice of vaccination to the compromised immune function due to zone 3 dysfunction. Thus, all arguments overlap in their support of the claim through the lens of zone 3's immune role.
