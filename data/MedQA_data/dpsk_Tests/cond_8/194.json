Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common semantic intersection. While some arguments (e.g., EBV causing lymphocytic infiltrates and being associated with CNS lymphoma) overlap in their reasoning about EBV's role in CNS conditions, the argument about HIV-associated CNS lymphoma introduces a distinct idea that does not semantically overlap with the EBV-related justifications. Thus, not all pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification.
