Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the likelihood of osteoarthritis explaining joint effusion, while the second argument explicitly states that pannus formation is not expected in osteoarthritis but rather in rheumatoid arthritis. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without a common idea or reasoning pattern.
