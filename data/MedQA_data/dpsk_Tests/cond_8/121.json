Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument suggests an infectious cause (surgical site infection or urinary tract infection) for the patient's symptoms, while the second argument considers a transfusion reaction as a possible cause. These are distinct and non-overlapping explanations for the symptoms.
