Justification: While all arguments relate to preventing kidney stones, they do not all share overlapping semantic justifications regarding sodium intake. For example, the argument about increasing fluid intake does not overlap in justification with the arguments about sodium reduction, as they address different mechanisms of prevention. Similarly, the arguments about oxalate restriction and calcium intake modulation focus on different dietary factors than sodium intake.
