Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that a shattered calcaneus repaired with surgery (especially with multiple screws) leads to long-term pain during inversion and eversion of the foot. Each justification emphasizes different aspects of this core idea, such as altered biomechanics, surgical outcomes, severity of injury, or rehabilitation observations, but all overlap in supporting the claim.
