Result: false
Justification: The arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim, but the third argument ("The symptoms developed slowly over 2 weeks, which is atypical for acute dystonia, as it usually presents more abruptly.") introduces a contrasting point that does not align with the other arguments supporting the claim. This creates a lack of complete semantic overlap among all pairs of arguments.
