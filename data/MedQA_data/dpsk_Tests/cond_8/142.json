Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that the antibodies will bind to hemidesmosomes, not gap junctions, based on the characteristic of bullous pemphigoid. The second argument states that gap junctions are not the target of IgG antibodies in autoimmune blistering disorders because they are involved in intercellular communication. While both arguments oppose the claim that the antibodies bind to gap junctions, their justifications are based on different reasoning (one on the specific disease characteristic and the other on the function of gap junctions), and thus do not overlap semantically.
