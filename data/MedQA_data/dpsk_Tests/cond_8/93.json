Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic justification in relation to the claim, which is the association of the infant's symptoms with 22q11 deletion syndrome. Each argument provides different aspects of the syndrome (e.g., VSD, congestive heart failure, statistical likelihood, absence of cyanosis, normal APGAR score, and lack of alternative explanations) that collectively support the claim. Therefore, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justification by linking the patient's symptoms to 22q11 deletion syndrome.
