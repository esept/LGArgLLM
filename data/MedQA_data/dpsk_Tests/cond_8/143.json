Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument connects the patient's symptoms (chest pain, murmur, tall stature, joint hypermobility) and clinical findings (hypotension, tachycardia) to mitral valve prolapse, which is characterized by a late systolic crescendo murmur and mid-systolic click. The justifications consistently reference the patient's history, physical exam findings, and the pathophysiology of mitral valve prolapse, ensuring semantic overlap across all argument pairs.
