Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the patient's recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and meningitis are due to a deficiency in the complement system, specifically C3b, which acts as an important opsonin. Each argument's justification revolves around this central concept, linking the patient's clinical history to the role of C3b in the innate immune system. Thus, all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
