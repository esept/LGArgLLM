Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to the patient's symptoms, background, or physical findings as evidence of malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies, which inherently includes vitamin deficiencies. The common themes include the patient's refugee status, symptoms of malnutrition, and the link between these symptoms and nutritional (including vitamin) deficiencies.
