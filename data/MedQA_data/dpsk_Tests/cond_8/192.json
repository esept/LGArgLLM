Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, some arguments suggest that Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is likely absent due to glycolytic activity (A1, A2, A5), while others argue for its presence due to the TCA cycle's essential role (A3, A6) or lack of direct inhibition (A4). These justifications do not overlap semantically in a way that supports the claim uniformly.
