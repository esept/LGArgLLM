Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that clozapine requires CBC monitoring due to the risk of agranulocytosis and the importance of adhering to clinical guidelines for patient safety. Each argument reinforces this central point, whether by mentioning the specific risk (agranulocytosis), the timing of monitoring (initial 2 weeks), or the broader context (treatment-resistant schizophrenia and positive response). Thus, all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
