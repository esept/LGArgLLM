Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. While some arguments (e.g., those discussing cAMP's role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release) overlap in their reasoning, others (e.g., the argument about synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease altering cAMP signaling) introduce distinct ideas that do not directly intersect with the other justifications. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
