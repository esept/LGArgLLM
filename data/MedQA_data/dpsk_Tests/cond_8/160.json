Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about "Other common causes of pruritic rash" does not overlap with the arguments focusing on cytotoxic T-cell mechanisms, as it suggests alternative explanations not involving cytotoxic T-cells. Similarly, the argument about the "rapid onset" being atypical for cytotoxic T-cell reactions contradicts the other arguments supporting cytotoxic T-cell mechanisms.
