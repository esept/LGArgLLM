Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share semantic intersections in their justifications. For example, the first two arguments focus on hyperestrinism as a cause of lower limb swelling, while the third and fourth arguments argue that hyperestrinism is not the primary cause and instead emphasize portal hypertension and hypoalbuminemia. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern shared between all pairs of arguments.
