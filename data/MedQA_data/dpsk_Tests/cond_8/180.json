Result: false
Justification: The first argument states that selective alpha-1 agonists are commonly prescribed for nasal congestion due to their vasoconstrictive effects, while the second argument focuses on viral infections as a frequent cause of nasal congestion. The third argument introduces non-viral factors like allergies or environmental irritants. While the first two arguments share a common idea about nasal congestion, the third argument diverges by introducing a different cause (non-viral factors) that may not require the same treatment. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
