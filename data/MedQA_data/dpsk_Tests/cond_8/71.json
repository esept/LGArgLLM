Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the efflux of calcium ions being necessary for myocyte relaxation. Each argument emphasizes the role of calcium ion removal in terminating contraction and enabling relaxation, supported by established physiological theories and research. The overlapping ideas include calcium efflux disengaging sarcomeres, terminating actin-myosin interaction, lowering cytosolic calcium levels, and deactivating troponin. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
