Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that cilostazol's mechanism of action is as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Each justification either directly states this or elaborates on how this mechanism works (e.g., increasing cyclic AMP levels, vasodilation, or its documentation in pharmacological literature). Thus, all justifications semantically overlap in relation to the claim.
