Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the cardiovascular abnormalities (hypertension) associated with Turner syndrome, while the second argument discusses the possibility of a mosaic karyotype or mild phenotypes leading to a later diagnosis. These are distinct aspects of Turner syndrome and do not intersect in their reasoning or support for the claim.
