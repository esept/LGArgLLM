Result: false
Justification: The arguments share some overlapping ideas (e.g., hereditary patterns, early-onset colonoscopies, and family history), but the third argument introduces a contrasting point about variable inheritance patterns (e.g., Lynch syndrome) that does not align with the shared reasoning of the other arguments supporting autosomal dominant inheritance. Thus, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
