Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic justification related to the symptoms and effects of marijuana intoxication. The first argument mentions conjunctival injection and dry mouth, the second mentions anxiety and cognitive effects, and the third mentions tachycardia. While each argument focuses on different symptoms, they all collectively support the claim that marijuana is the most likely intoxication by pointing to various effects of marijuana use. Therefore, all pairs of arguments share at least one common idea related to the claim.
