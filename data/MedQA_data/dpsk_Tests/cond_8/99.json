Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. For example, the argument stating "A baseline X-ray could be useful to confirm the severity of osteoarthritis and rule out other conditions like fractures or tumors, especially given the worsening symptoms" suggests that further work-up might be needed, which contradicts the claim that no further work-up is needed. Similarly, the argument about laboratory tests (ESR or CRP) also implies that further work-up could be warranted. These arguments do not align with the claim and do not share a common idea with the other arguments that fully support the claim.
