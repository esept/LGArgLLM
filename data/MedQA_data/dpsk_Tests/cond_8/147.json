Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms, lab results, and radiographic findings are consistent with a granulomatous infection, specifically tuberculosis, which involves granuloma formation with epithelioid and Langhans cells. Each argument reinforces this central theme, making their justifications semantically overlapping in relation to the claim.
