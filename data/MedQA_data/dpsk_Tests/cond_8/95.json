Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument ties the patient's symptoms (e.g., morning headaches, nausea, vomiting), history (e.g., prior meningitis treated with antibiotics), and MRI findings (e.g., bilateral ventricular enlargement) to impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations, which is the core idea supporting the claim. The arguments consistently reference the same underlying mechanism (impaired CSF flow) and its consequences (e.g., hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure), ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
