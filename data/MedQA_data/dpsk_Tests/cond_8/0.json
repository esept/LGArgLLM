Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms are indicative of Bell's palsy, which is typically treated with corticosteroids like methylprednisolone. Each argument either directly states or implies that methylprednisolone is a suitable treatment given the patient's condition, previous treatment with corticosteroids, and the absence of contraindications due to her well-controlled diabetes. Thus, all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
