Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share any overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the administration of ampicillin and progesterone without providing any justification, while the second argument provides two separate justifications for the use of ampicillin (prophylaxis against GBS infection) and progesterone (delaying delivery and reducing neonatal morbidity). There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern shared between the justifications of these arguments in relation to the claim.
