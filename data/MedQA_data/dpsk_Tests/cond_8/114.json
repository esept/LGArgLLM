Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first and second arguments focus on subacromial bursitis and its symptoms, while the third argument introduces adhesive capsulitis as a possible diagnosis, which is a different condition. The fourth argument returns to subacromial bursitis but does not overlap with the third argument's focus on adhesive capsulitis. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
