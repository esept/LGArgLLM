Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to specific clinical findings (e.g., MRI results, cognitive deficits, confabulation) that are strongly associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is typically caused by chronic alcohol use disorder. The justifications consistently link these findings to alcohol use disorder as the most likely predisposing factor, creating a common thread across all arguments.
