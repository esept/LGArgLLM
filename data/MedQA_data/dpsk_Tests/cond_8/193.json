Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that Bupropion should be avoided in this patient due to the increased risk of seizures associated with a history of eating disorders (specifically binge eating and purging behavior). Each argument either directly states this risk, mentions the contraindication in clinical guidelines, or suggests alternative treatments for the same underlying reason.
