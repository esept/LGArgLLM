Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common idea that the patient's obesity is the primary cause of his knee pain and related symptoms. The first argument directly links obesity to osteoarthritis, which explains the patient's symptoms. The second argument dismisses rheumatoid arthritis as a likely cause, indirectly supporting obesity as the underlying issue. The third argument reinforces the connection between obesity and mechanical joint damage, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. Thus, all pairs of arguments overlap in their justifications by focusing on obesity as the root cause.
