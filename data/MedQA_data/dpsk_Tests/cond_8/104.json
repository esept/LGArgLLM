Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern that directly supports the claim of a 20% ejection fraction. The first argument mentions compensatory mechanisms but does not confirm the ejection fraction, the second links risk factors to the claim without direct evidence, and the third uses symptoms and hemodynamic parameters to suggest severe systolic dysfunction. While all relate to the claim, they do not overlap semantically in their justifications.
