Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided focus on different developmental milestones and behaviors of the three children, each corresponding to a specific age (1 month, 4 months, and 9 months). While all arguments support the claim that the children's ages are represented as 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months, the justifications do not overlap semantically. Each argument discusses distinct aspects of development (e.g., motor skills, social behavior, feeding patterns) specific to each age group, without shared reasoning or propositions across pairs of arguments.
