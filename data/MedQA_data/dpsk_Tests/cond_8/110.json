Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the impaired function of the SERCA1 pump due to ATP2A1 mutations, leading to elevated cytosolic calcium levels and prolonged muscle relaxation. The justifications consistently reference the physiological mechanism of calcium reuptake impairment and its consequences, aligning with the claim's assertions.
