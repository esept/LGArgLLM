Result: false
Justification: The first two arguments share a common idea that confirmatory tests for HIV can include genotyping to identify viral strains or drug resistance, which is relevant for treatment planning. However, the third argument contradicts this by stating that the primary purpose of a confirmatory test is to verify the presence of the virus, not necessarily to determine its genotype. This lack of semantic overlap in justifications between the third argument and the first two means not all pairs share a common idea.
