Result: false
Justification: The justifications do not all share a common semantic overlap. For example, the first two arguments focus on hemoptysis and its potential complications (pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, pulmonary congestion), while the third and fourth arguments shift focus to cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and ventricular fibrillation, which are different concerns. The fifth argument also diverges by discussing the rarity of hemoptysis compared to other complications. Thus, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
