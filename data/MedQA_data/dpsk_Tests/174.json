He had been treated for urinary tract infections twice in the past 6 months. He is currently taking infliximab. Cystoscopy shows pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall. Biopsy of these lesions shows a focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: If the patient\"s bladder finding is caused by a vitamin deficiency, then the feature of photodermatitis is also most likely to be observed.",
