He feels well but has not seen a physician in several years, and his immunization records are unavailable. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show: Anti-HAV IgM Positive Anti-HAV IgG Negative HBsAg Negative Anti-HBs Positive HBcAg Negative Anti-HBc Negative HBeAg Negative Anti-HBe Negative Anti-HCV Negative.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s laboratory findings are best explained by previous hepatitis A infection.",
