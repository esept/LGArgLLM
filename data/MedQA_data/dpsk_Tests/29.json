Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse. There are no audible murmurs. An S4 is present.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
