Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is \u2018a fatty\u2019 and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Cognitive-behavioral therapy is the best option for long-term management of this patient\"s condition.",
