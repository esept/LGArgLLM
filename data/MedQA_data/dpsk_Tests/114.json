  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 65-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for stiffness in his arm. He states that he has been having trouble combing his hair and reaching objects that are high on the shelf. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and hypertension. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient admits to leading a sedentary life in which he tends to stay home and watch television. He does not engage in any physical or strenuous activity. On physical exam the patient has decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder. Strength of the patient\"s upper extremity is 4/5.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Subacromial bursitis.",
