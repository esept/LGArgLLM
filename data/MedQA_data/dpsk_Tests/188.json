These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient is experiencing symptoms of acute dystonia.",
