  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been unable to conceive for 3 years. Analysis of her husband\"s semen has shown normal sperm counts during this time. The patient also reports episodic pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea for 5 years. She has about one such episode on average per month for 4\u20136 days. She has taken ibuprofen for the pain, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 29-day intervals since menarche at the age of 14 years and last for 7 days. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use contraception. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic and bimanual examinations are normal; rectal examination is unremarkable. A hysterosalpingogram 6 months prior showed normal results.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient\"s symptoms is a smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium.",
