  "claim": "Consider the following background information: An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because he has excessively dry skin. His mother says that he has had dry, scaly skin since he was 6 months old. She says it is worse in winter and better in summer. There is no associated itching, redness, or discharge. Examination reveals generalized fine scales with coarse skin all over the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae (see image). There are multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Pityriasis versicolor.",
