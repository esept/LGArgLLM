  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help. He has been unable to go to work because of his symptoms. The patient has been previously hospitalized for a tricuspid valve replacement surgery 1 year ago and takes aspirin daily. The medical history is also relevant for myocardial infarction 3 years ago and hypertension for the past 10 years, for which he takes lisinopril. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, the respirations are 18/minute, and the temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F). On examination, several hemorrhages are noted on the nail beds of several fingers.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Friable irregular masses attached to the valve would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis.",
