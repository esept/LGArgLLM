Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the increased production of nitric oxide and its connection to decreased arginine concentrations in vascular endothelial cells. Each argument provides a different reason or mechanism (e.g., arginine as a substrate for nitric oxide synthase, effects of lisinopril, temporal arteritis, vasodilation in hypertension, or biopsy-induced inflammation) that supports the claim, but they all converge on the same underlying idea. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
