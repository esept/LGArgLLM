Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing different pieces of evidence that collectively support the diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome due to alcohol use disorder. Each argument highlights a different aspect of the patient's condition (neuroimaging findings, clinical presentation, memory pattern, and absence of alternative explanations) that is characteristic of alcohol-related cognitive disorders. Thus, there is overlap in their semantic contributions to supporting the claim.
