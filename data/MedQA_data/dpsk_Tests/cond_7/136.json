Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the argument about fibrates being the likely prescribed drug (due to their effects on triglycerides, HDL, and LDL) and the argument about fibrates interfering with vitamin D absorption share a common semantic subset (fibrates as the drug in question). Thus, there is overlap in meaning between these justifications with respect to the claim.
