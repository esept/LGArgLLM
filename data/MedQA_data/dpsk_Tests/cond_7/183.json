Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the potential for interviewer bias due to awareness of the child's ASD status, while another argues that the high response rate reduces the likelihood of non-response bias and suggests interviewer bias may not be the primary concern. These justifications address different aspects of the study design and potential biases, without overlapping in their semantic contribution to the claim.
