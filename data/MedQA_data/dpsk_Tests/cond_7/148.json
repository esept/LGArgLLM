Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument supports bone scintigraphy as useful for detecting osteomyelitis or other bone infections, while the second argues that it is redundant given the bone biopsy has already confirmed the diagnosis. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
