Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are related to the mechanism of action of cilostazol as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. They overlap semantically in supporting the claim by explaining how cilostazol works and its documented effects. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
