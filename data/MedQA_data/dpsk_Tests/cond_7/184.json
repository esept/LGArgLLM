Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument states that HIF-1Î± mRNA may be upregulated in RCC due to mimicry of hypoxic conditions, while another argues that the primary mechanism is protein stabilization, not transcriptional upregulation, implying mRNA levels might not differ. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
