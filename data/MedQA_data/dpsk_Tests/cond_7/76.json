Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their discussion of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) secretion in relation to the patient's condition. For example, multiple arguments mention that BNP is typically secreted in response to ventricular stretch or volume overload, which is not consistent with the patient's hypovolemia due to diarrhea and vomiting. This shared semantic content means the justifications are not disjoint.
