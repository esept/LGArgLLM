Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss hyperestrinism leading to fluid retention, which overlaps in meaning. However, the third and fourth arguments introduce new concepts (portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, increased hydrostatic pressure, decreased oncotic pressure) that are not directly related to the hyperestrinism discussed in the first two arguments. Thus, there is at least one pair of arguments (e.g., the first and third) whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
