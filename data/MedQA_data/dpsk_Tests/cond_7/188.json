Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the patient's symptoms and their connection to acute dystonia as a side effect of haloperidol. For example, the first and fourth arguments both discuss haloperidol's role in causing acute dystonia, while the second and third arguments discuss the timeline of symptom onset, albeit with differing perspectives on typicality. Thus, there is overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim.
