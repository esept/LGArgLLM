Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. All arguments reference the patient's history of a heart murmur, physical findings (tall stature, joint hypermobility), and the clinical presentation (chest pain, hemodynamic instability) as consistent with mitral valve prolapse, which is associated with a late systolic crescendo murmur and mid-systolic click. Thus, none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
