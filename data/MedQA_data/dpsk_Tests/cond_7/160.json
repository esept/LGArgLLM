Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, multiple arguments reference the role of cytotoxic T-cell destruction in drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., A1, A2, A4). However, there are also arguments (e.g., A3, A5) that introduce alternative explanations or contradict the main claim, making some pairs of arguments semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For instance, A3 discusses other causes of pruritic rash without invoking cytotoxic T-cell mechanisms, which is disjoint from the justifications of A1, A2, and A4. Similarly, A5 questions the timing of the rash, which is disjoint from the other arguments supporting the claim. Thus, at least one pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
