Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the patient's symptoms (e.g., stress incontinence, leakage during Valsalva) and clinical history (e.g., vaginal delivery, cesarean section) as evidence for urethral hypermobility. These overlapping justifications mean the arguments are not semantically disjoint.
