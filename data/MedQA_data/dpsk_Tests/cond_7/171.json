Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments share a common semantic subset related to Turner syndrome and its potential to cause hypertension or cardiovascular abnormalities in the patient. Both arguments contribute to the support of the claim by highlighting features of Turner syndrome that align with the patient's symptoms, thus they are not semantically disjoint.
