Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each justification provides a distinct reason or piece of evidence supporting the claim about cAMP accumulation and neurotransmitter release, without overlapping in meaning. For example, one justification discusses the role of cAMP as a second messenger, another focuses on the effect of electrical stimulation, another on variability in timing, another on cAMP-dependent pathways, and the last on Alzheimer's disease-specific dysfunction. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim.
