Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim that cladribine is the most effective pharmacotherapy for the patient's condition (hairy cell leukemia). For example, multiple arguments reference cladribine's high response rates and its alignment with the patient's symptoms and lab findings. Additionally, some arguments compare cladribine to other treatments (e.g., rituximab, interferon-alpha), which further ties their justifications to the same semantic context. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
