Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the physical symptoms (thin appearance, temporal wasting) suggesting malnutrition and vitamin deficiency, while the second argument emphasizes the social history (living alone, recent bereavement) as a cause for dietary neglect. These justifications address different aspects of the patient's condition without overlapping in their support for the claim.
