Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the deficiency in the complement system, particularly C3b, and its role as an opsonin in the innate immune system. Each justification supports the claim by referencing the patient's history of infections with encapsulated bacteria and the implications of a C3b deficiency, making them semantically overlapping rather than disjoint.
