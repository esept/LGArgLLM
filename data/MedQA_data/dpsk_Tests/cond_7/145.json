Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments discuss the relationship between pregnancy, hormonal changes, and epithelial proliferation, which are all related to the claim about hyperplasia causing the observed change. Since the justifications are not semantically disjoint, the result is false.
