Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the same underlying reasoningâ€”that the observed features (microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, VSD, IUGR, and polyhydramnios) are strongly suggestive of Trisomy 18, which is associated with a prominent occiput. Since all justifications overlap in their support for the claim by referencing Trisomy 18 and its features, none of the pairs are semantically disjoint.
