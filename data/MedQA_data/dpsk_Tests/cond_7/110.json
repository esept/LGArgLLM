Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all revolve around the same core idea: the loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump (SERCA1) due to ATP2A1 mutations leads to impaired calcium reuptake, resulting in prolonged elevated cytosolic calcium levels and delayed muscle relaxation. Each argument provides slightly different supporting evidence (e.g., biochemical studies, clinical observations, physiological mechanisms), but they all contribute to the same overarching conclusion. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
