Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. The first and second arguments both discuss the benefits of folic acid supplementation in the context of the patient's condition (bipolar disorder and potential pregnancy risks), while the third argument shifts focus to the priority of medication compliance. The overlap in the first two arguments means they are not semantically disjoint.
