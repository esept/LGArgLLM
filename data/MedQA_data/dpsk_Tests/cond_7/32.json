Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the mechanism of action of chlorhexidine, specifically its pH-dependency and reduced efficacy in the presence of organic matter. Since none of the pairs of arguments have disjoint justifications with respect to the claim, the result is false.
