Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the association between 22q11 deletion syndrome and congenital heart defects (e.g., VSD), as well as the typical presentation of symptoms like difficulty breathing and listlessness. These shared semantic elements mean the justifications are not disjoint.
