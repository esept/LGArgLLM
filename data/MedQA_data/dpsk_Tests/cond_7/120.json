Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first two justifications focus on the importance of genotyping for treatment planning and drug resistance, while the third justification states that the primary purpose of a confirmatory test is to verify the presence of the virus, not necessarily its genotype. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
