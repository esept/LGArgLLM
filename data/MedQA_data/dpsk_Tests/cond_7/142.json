Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument states that the antibodies will bind to hemidesmosomes, which is characteristic of bullous pemphigoid, while the second argument explains that gap junctions are not the target of IgG antibodies in autoimmune blistering disorders. These justifications address different aspects of the claim and do not share a common semantic subset.
