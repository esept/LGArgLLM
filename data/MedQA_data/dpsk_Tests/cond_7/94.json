Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all describe a sequential pathway of lymphatic and systemic circulation that explains how ovarian cancer could metastasize to the brain. Each justification builds on the previous one, forming a coherent and interconnected explanation. For example, the sentinel node leads to the right lumbar trunk, which connects to the cisterna chyli, and so on. Thus, there is significant semantic overlap in how they support the claim.
