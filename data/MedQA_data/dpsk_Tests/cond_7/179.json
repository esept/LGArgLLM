Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first two arguments support performing a low dose dexamethasone suppression test, while the last two argue for proceeding directly to imaging (adrenal CT or MRI) instead. These two groups of arguments do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
