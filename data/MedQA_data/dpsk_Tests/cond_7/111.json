Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that the difference observed between the two strata can be explained by effect modification. Each argument provides a different perspective or evidence (statistical, biological, definitional) supporting this claim, but they all converge on the same core idea of effect modification by CD4+ count. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
