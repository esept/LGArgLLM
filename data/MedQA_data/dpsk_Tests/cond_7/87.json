Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the anatomical and clinical evidence supporting the occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) in the given scenario. For example, multiple arguments reference the posterior descending artery (PDA) and its typical origin from the RCA in right-dominant circulation, as well as the clinical and imaging findings consistent with RCA occlusion. Thus, there is significant overlap in the justifications.
