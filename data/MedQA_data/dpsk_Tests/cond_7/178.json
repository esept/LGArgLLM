Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, the patient's anxiety, delayed responses, and difficulty processing thoughts (second argument) are related to the psychoactive effects of marijuana, which also explains the conjunctival injection and dry mouth (first argument) and tachycardia (third argument). All justifications point to symptoms consistent with marijuana intoxication, so they are not semantically disjoint.
