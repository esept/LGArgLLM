Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why the presentation is more consistent with HSV than CMV (e.g., typical presentation of HSV, atypical presentation of CMV, classic symptoms of herpetic gingivostomatitis, and rarity of CMV stomatitis). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
