Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the patient's pulse and blood pressure as indicators but notes they are not diagnostic. The second argument ties the patient's medical history to the risk of systolic dysfunction. The third argument emphasizes the combination of symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. While all support the claim, they do so based on distinct and non-overlapping justifications.
