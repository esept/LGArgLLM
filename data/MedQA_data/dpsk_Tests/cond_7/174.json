Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all arguments share a common semantic subset related to vitamin A deficiency causing both bladder findings (squamous metaplasia with hyperkeratosis) and photodermatitis. They all contribute to supporting the claim by explaining the link between these two manifestations under the same deficiency. Thus, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
