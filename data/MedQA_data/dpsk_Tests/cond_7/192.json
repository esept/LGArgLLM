Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument discusses the association of elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase with glycolytic activity and reduced reliance on the TCA cycle, while another argues that the TCA cycle remains essential for biosynthetic precursor production even in glycolytically active cells. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
