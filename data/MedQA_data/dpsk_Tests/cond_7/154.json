Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that lymphoma can cause pleural effusions (e.g., "Lymphoma can cause pleural effusions..." and "The elevated pleural fluid protein and LDH levels..."). Additionally, several arguments discuss the patient's symptoms and pleural fluid analysis in the context of lymphoma, indicating shared semantic subsets that contribute to supporting the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is completely disjoint.
