Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the patient's infection and the possibility of antibiotic resistance, which are related concepts contributing to the claim about bacterial adaptation. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both address the need for further testing or alternative treatments, which are also related. Thus, there is overlap in the semantic content of the justifications.
