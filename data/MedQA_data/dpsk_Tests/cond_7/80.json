Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint. The first two arguments focus on the possibility of gag gene mutations causing resistance to therapy, while the third argument suggests that the symptoms are more consistent with an opportunistic infection, not a gag gene mutation. There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications that supports the claim in the same way.
