Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument suggests an infectious cause (surgical site infection or urinary tract infection) for the patient's symptoms, while the second argument considers a transfusion reaction. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
