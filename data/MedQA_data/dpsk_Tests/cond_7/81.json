Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments focus on the diagnosis of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) and the inappropriateness of administering acyclovir, each providing different aspects of the clinical presentation and reasoning (e.g., CSF findings, clinical symptoms, and recommended treatments for GBS). Thus, they share a common semantic subset related to the claim.
