Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on reducing sodium intake to decrease urinary calcium excretion, while another emphasizes increasing fluid intake to maintain urine output. These justifications address different mechanisms for preventing kidney stones and do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to supporting the claim.
