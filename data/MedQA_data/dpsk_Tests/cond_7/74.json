Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the patient's risk factors (nulliparity, late menopause, postmenopausal bleeding) and symptoms (adnexal mass, ascites) that are associated with endometrial pathology, including proliferation of endometrial glands. This shared semantic content means the justifications are not disjoint.
