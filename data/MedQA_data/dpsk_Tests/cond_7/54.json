Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications argue that the clinical presentation suggests an infectious or immunological disorder rather than a chromosomal abnormality, and both mention specific findings (oral thrush, recurrent infections) that point towards immunodeficiency. Thus, they share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
