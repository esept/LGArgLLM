Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments overlap in their support for the claim. Both justifications mention the use of ampicillin in the context of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and the need to delay delivery at 32 weeks' gestation. The first justification focuses on ampicillin for GBS prophylaxis, while the second mentions both antibiotics (which would include ampicillin) and progesterone for delaying delivery. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
