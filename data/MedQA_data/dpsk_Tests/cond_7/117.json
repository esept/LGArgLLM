Result: false
Justification: All the arguments provided share a common semantic subset related to the mechanism of action of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for GERD treatment. Each justification discusses how PPIs work by irreversibly inhibiting H+/K+-ATPase in parietal cells, their superior efficacy compared to H2 blockers, and their role as first-line treatment for GERD when H2 blockers fail. Thus, there is no pair of arguments with disjoint justifications.
