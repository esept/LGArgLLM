Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are related to the claim that compression ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management. They all discuss aspects of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), its diagnosis, and why compression ultrasonography is indicated in this context. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint; they all contribute to supporting the claim by addressing different facets of the same clinical scenario.
