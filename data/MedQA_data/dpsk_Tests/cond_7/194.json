Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the association of Epstein-Barr virus with the patient's condition, such as lymphocytic infiltrates, primary CNS lymphoma, HIV-associated CNS lymphoma, and CNS lymphoproliferative disorders. There is no overlap in the semantic content of these justifications.
