Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. All arguments reference the patient's symptoms (e.g., chronic fatigue, rotund abdomen, edema) and background (e.g., refugee status, food insecurity) as evidence of malnutrition, which includes vitamin deficiencies. The semantic content of their justifications is not disjoint; they all contribute to the same line of reasoning supporting the claim.
