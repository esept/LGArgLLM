Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing different supporting reasons for why the patient's symptoms are likely due to the injection of the vaccine into the inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock. For example, the first and fourth arguments both discuss the risk of sciatic nerve injury due to improper injection technique, while the second and third arguments provide additional supporting evidence regarding the timing of symptoms and the absence of other complications. Thus, there is overlap in their semantic contributions to the claim.
