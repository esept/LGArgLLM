Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the classic symptoms of osteoarthritis making further work-up unnecessary, while another suggests a baseline X-ray could be useful to confirm severity or rule out other conditions. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
