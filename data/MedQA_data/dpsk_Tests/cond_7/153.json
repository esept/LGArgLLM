Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss pulmonary fibrosis and its impact on lung compliance, which is a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim. Similarly, the first and fourth arguments both mention findings consistent with restrictive lung disease, which also overlaps in meaning. Therefore, there are pairs of arguments whose justifications share common semantic subsets.
