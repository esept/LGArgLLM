Result: true
Justification: The two arguments provided have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on fluphenazine's side effect of hypothermia, which directly supports the claim that fluphenazine is the cause. The second justification discusses the broader context of the patient's medication history and potential non-adherence or interactions, which does not directly support the claim about fluphenazine but rather introduces an alternative consideration. There is no overlap in the semantic content of these justifications in supporting the claim.
