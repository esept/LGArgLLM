Result: false
Justification: All the provided arguments share a common semantic subset related to the contraindication of Bupropion in patients with a history of eating disorders due to the increased risk of seizures. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. They all reinforce the same underlying reason for avoiding Bupropion in this patient.
