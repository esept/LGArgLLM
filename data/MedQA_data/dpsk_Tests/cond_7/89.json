Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments discuss the patient's symptoms and the potential need for adjusting insulin dosage, with overlapping themes of nocturnal hypoglycemia and insulin dose management. For example, the first and third arguments both mention nocturnal hypoglycemia and its relation to insulin dosage, indicating a shared semantic subset.
