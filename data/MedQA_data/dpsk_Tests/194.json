  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 39-year-old man is brought to the emergency department unconscious following 2 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. According to the attendants, he has complained of recurrent headaches for the past 2 weeks. There is no history of fever, head trauma, or a seizure disorder. The patient does not smoke cigarettes but reportedly drinks 2 glasses of wine daily. He has multiple sexual partners and history regarding the contraceptive use is unavailable. The patient\u2019s vitals include: blood pressure 137/88 mm Hg, temperature 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, he is obtunded. He grimaces on pain and localizes in response to pain in both upper extremities. Pupils are bilateral 3-mm in diameter and equally round and reactive. Laboratory tests are within normal limits. An MRI of the brain with contrast is shown in the exhibit (see image). A brain biopsy is performed that reveals perivascular clusters of lymphocytes.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Epstein-Barr virus is most associated with this patient\"s condition.",
