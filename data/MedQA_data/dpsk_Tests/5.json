  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with fatigue. He has been seen in the emergency room 5 times in the past 2 years for acute alcohol intoxication. His past medical history is notable for diabetes mellitus and gout. He takes metformin, glyburide, and allopurinol. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 16/min. He is in no acute distress. A positive fluid wave is noted. The dorsal surface of the tongue is depapillated, and there are erythematous swollen patches at the oral commissures. A complete blood count and iron studies are reported below:  Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL Hematocrit: 36% Leukocyte count: 6,000/mm^3 with normal differential Platelet count: 170,000/mm^3  Mean corpuscular volume: 70 um^3 Iron: 250 ug/dL Ferritin: 300 ng/mL Total iron binding capacity: 200 mcg/dL^3.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The finding of erythroblasts with mitochondrial iron deposits is most likely to be observed in this patient.",
