  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks. His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s ability to convert ferrous iron to ferric iron is most likely impaired.",
