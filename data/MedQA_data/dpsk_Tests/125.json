  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcoholism. He started becoming more confused a few days ago and it has been getting gradually worse. His temperature is 98.8\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 134/90 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a distended abdomen that is non-tender. Neurological exam is notable for a confused patient and asterixis. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.  Serum: Na+: 139 mEq/L Cl-: 100 mEq/L K+: 3.3 mEq/L HCO3-: 22 mEq/L BUN: 20 mg/dL Glucose: 59 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Ceftriaxone is the best next treatment for this patient.",
