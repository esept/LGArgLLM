During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Phrenic nerve damage is the most likely cause of the patient\"s hoarseness.",
