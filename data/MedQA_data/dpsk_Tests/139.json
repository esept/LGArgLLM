  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 47-year-old man presents to his family physician with a sudden onset of severe pain and redness in his eyes that started this morning. He is having difficulty seeing properly and is extremely worried about losing his vision. Further history reveals that he has had progressive lower back pain for over 2 months now. The pain is usually at its worst in the morning, but it remains throughout the day. It gets better with movement, however, so he tends to do some light exercises every day. He also has heel pain and feels significant pressure while walking. Laboratory analysis reveals increased ESR and CRP serum levels.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Aortic regurgitation is the most likely to be seen in this patient.",
