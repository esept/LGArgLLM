  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 17-year-old high school student was in shop class when he accidentally sawed off his pointer finger while making a bird house. He fainted when he realized his finger had been cut off. The teacher immediately transported the patient to the emergency department and he arrived within 20 minutes. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his only medication is an albuterol inhaler. The patient\"s current blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg. Analgesics are administered. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but that the principal would be transporting it to the hospital.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Wrap the amputated finger in moist gauze, put it in a plastic bag, and place it on ice is the correct method of transporting the amputated finger.",
