  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 21-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. His mother noticed deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently. He has been healthy apart from an upper respiratory tract infection 6 months ago. He was delivered at 38 weeks\" gestation. His 6-year-old sister was treated for developmental dysplasia of the hip. He can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase. He plays well with other children at his day care. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles. The knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together. The gait is unremarkable. The mother is concerned that he has a growth disorder.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: An X-ray of the lower extremities is the most appropriate next step in management.",
