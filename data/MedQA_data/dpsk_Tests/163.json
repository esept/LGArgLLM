The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago and has since tried several antipsychotic medications, none of which have been able to treat his negative symptoms. He has changed to clozapine 2 weeks ago and says that he does feel better. His physical exam is unremarkable, and he is responding appropriately to questioning.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: If this patient\u2019s current medication is to be continued, a complete blood count should be ordered at this time.",
