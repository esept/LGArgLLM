  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not \u201ckeeping up\u201d with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:  Serum: Na+: 139 mEq/L K+: 4.1 mEq/L Cl-: 100 mEq/L HCO3-: 24 mEq/L Urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL Glucose: 73 mg/dL Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL Ca2+: 9.7 mg/dL Mg2+: 1.7 mEq/L AST: 11 U/L ALT: 11 U/L Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml) Estrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)  Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a vaginal septum.",
