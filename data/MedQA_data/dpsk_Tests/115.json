  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 3-year-old male is brought by his mother to the pediatrician\"s office. The mother and child are refugees from Somalia and arrived in the United States one week ago. They were recently placed in temporary housing. The mother reports that the child has been chronically tired and subdued since before their arrival in the United States. The child was born at 38 weeks gestation with the help of a local midwife. The child\u2019s temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/60 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a listless child with a rotund abdomen and positive fluid wave. Notable lower extremity edema is present.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: This patient\"s condition is most likely caused by a deficiency in Vitamin intake.",
