  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness visit. She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months. She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Elevated TSH  levels will most likely be found in this patient.",
