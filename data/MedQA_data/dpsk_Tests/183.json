  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A group of researchers conducted a study to determine whether there is an association between folic acid supplementation before pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers with children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers with healthy children. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01).\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Interviewer bias is the most likely type of bias to have influenced these results.",
