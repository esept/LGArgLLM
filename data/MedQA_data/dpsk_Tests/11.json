  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient has presented three times this past month with similar complaints. The patient sees no primary care physician and is currently not taking any medications. The patient states his shortness of breath started when he was walking from his car to a local restaurant. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 100/min, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. On physical exam you note a fatigued appearing gentleman. Cardiovascular exam reveals an additional heart sound after S2. Pulmonary exam is notable for bilateral crackles. Abdominal exam reveals an obese abdomen without pain in any of the quadrants. Lower extremity pitting edema is noted bilaterally.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s presentation is most likely consistent with high BNP, high ADH , low sodium, and low potassium levels.",
