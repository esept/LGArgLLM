  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 41-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with abdominal pain. He says that the pain \u201ccomes and goes\u201d throughout the day and usually lasts 20-30 minutes per episode. He can point to the spot 1-2 inches above the umbilicus where he feels the pain. He denies any feeling of regurgitation or nighttime cough but endorses nausea. He reports that he used to eat three large meals per day but has found that eating more frequently improves his pain. He tried a couple pills of ibuprofen with food over the past couple days and thinks it helped. He has gained four pounds since his past appointment three months ago. The patient denies any diarrhea or change in his stools. He has no past medical history. He drinks 5-6 beers on the weekend and has a 20 pack-year smoking history. He denies any family history of cancer. On physical exam, he is tender to palpation above the umbilicus. Bowel sounds are present. A stool guaiac test is positive. The patient undergoes endoscopy with biopsy to diagnose his condition.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine is most likely to be found on histology.",
