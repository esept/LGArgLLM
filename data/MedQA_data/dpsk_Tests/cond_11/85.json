Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications for why a CT angiogram is appropriate, focusing on the patient's risk factors and the need to evaluate vascular pathology. However, the S-type arguments present reasons why a CT angiogram may not be the best next step, such as potential risks from contrast and the availability of alternative imaging modalities. There is no semantic subset in the S-type arguments that supports the claim by being contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
