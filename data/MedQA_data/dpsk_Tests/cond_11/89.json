Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not fully cover all minimal semantic bases of the claim. Specifically, the S-type argument about the need for formal glucose monitoring to determine insulin adjustment needs is not contained within any P-type argument's justification. This is a critical piece of information for determining the optimal intervention, as symptoms alone cannot guide dosing decisions. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
