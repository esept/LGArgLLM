Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not fully cover the minimal semantic bases of the claim. Specifically, the S-type arguments provide critical information (e.g., hypothyroidism explaining hypothermia, atypical pupil response for fluphenazine toxicity, and absence of deep tendon reflexes suggesting another etiology) that is not contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
