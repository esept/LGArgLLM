Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that are not semantic subsets of the S-type arguments' justifications. Instead, the P-type arguments present alternative diagnoses (infectious or immunological disorders) that contradict the need for karyotyping. The S-type arguments support the claim by providing reasons why karyotyping is not indicated, but these do not form a semantic subset of the P-type arguments' justifications. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
