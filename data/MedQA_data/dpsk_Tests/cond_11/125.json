Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications for using ceftriaxone, such as its effectiveness against SBP and the patient's risk factors for SBP. However, the S-type arguments present counterpoints suggesting that the likelihood of SBP is low given the absence of typical signs like fever or abdominal tenderness. These counterpoints are not semantic subsets of the P-type justifications but rather oppose them, indicating that not all minimal semantic bases for the claim are covered by the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
