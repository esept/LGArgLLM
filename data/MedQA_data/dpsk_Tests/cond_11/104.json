Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that are consistent with the claim of a 20% ejection fraction based on clinical symptoms and hemodynamic parameters, but none of the S-type arguments' justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications. The S-type arguments highlight the lack of sufficient data to confirm the ejection fraction, which contradicts the claim rather than supporting it. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
