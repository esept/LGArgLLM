Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not have justifications that are semantic subsets of the S-type arguments' justifications. The S-type arguments focus on the redundancy of bone scintigraphy given the confirmed diagnosis and the urgency of antibiotic therapy, while the P-type arguments discuss the potential utility of bone scintigraphy in detecting infections and its redundancy post-diagnosis. There is no clear semantic subset relationship between the justifications of the P-type and S-type arguments. Additionally, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments.
