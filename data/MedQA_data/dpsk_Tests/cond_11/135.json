Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not contain justifications that are semantic subsets of the S-type arguments' justifications. The P-type arguments focus on malnutrition and dietary neglect, while the S-type arguments specifically address vitamin C deficiency and the irrelevance of lysine to the patient's symptoms. There is no overlap in meaning that would satisfy C11.
