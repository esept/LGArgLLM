Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains semantic subsets that align with the claim. The first P-argument's justification about conjunctival injection and dry mouth, the second about anxiety and cognitive effects, and the third about tachycardia all directly support the claim that marijuana is the most likely intoxication. These justifications cover the minimal semantic bases needed to support the claim, and there are no gaps in the support provided by the P-type arguments. The S-type arguments do not undermine the claim but rather suggest alternative explanations, which do not affect the sufficiency of the P-type justifications.
