Result: false  
Justification: The claim suggests that nasal congestion is the drug most likely prescribed due to a viral infection, but this is incorrect as nasal congestion is a symptom, not a drug. The P-type arguments correctly identify that selective alpha-1 agonists are prescribed for nasal congestion, which can be caused by viral infections, but they do not support the incorrect phrasing in the claim. The S-type arguments further clarify that other conditions and medications can also be involved, but none of the justifications support the claim as stated. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
