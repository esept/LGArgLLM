Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not fully cover all minimal semantic bases of the claim. Specifically, the first P-type argument focuses on infectious causes (surgical site infection or urinary tract infection) and does not address the transfusion reaction directly. The second P-type argument mentions transfusion reactions but does not provide a justification that is a semantic subset of any S-type argument's justification. Additionally, the S-type arguments provide reasons against the transfusion reaction (timing, absence of typical symptoms, and alternative causes), but these are not fully encapsulated or supported by the P-type arguments' justifications. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
