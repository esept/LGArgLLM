Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications for why angiography might be the next step based on the patient's history and symptoms, but none of the S-type arguments support the claim. Instead, the S-type arguments suggest alternative diagnoses or caution against immediate angiography, indicating that not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
