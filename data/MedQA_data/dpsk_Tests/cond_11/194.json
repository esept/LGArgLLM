Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with the patient's condition, but the S-type arguments present counterpoints that reduce the likelihood of EBV being the primary causative agent. Specifically, the S-type arguments highlight the absence of systemic symptoms and normal laboratory tests, which are not addressed or contradicted by the P-type arguments. Therefore, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments, failing to satisfy C11.
