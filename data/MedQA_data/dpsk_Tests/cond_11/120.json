Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments suggest that confirmatory tests for HIV may include genotyping, but the S-type arguments clarify that standard confirmatory tests (like Western blot or PCR) focus on detecting HIV antibodies or viral RNA, not genotyping. Genotyping is typically a separate test performed after confirmation. Therefore, the claim that the confirmatory test determines the genotype of the virus is not fully supported by the minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments.
