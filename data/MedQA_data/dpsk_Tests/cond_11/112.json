Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments provide a justification that contains the minimal semantic basis for the claim (i.e., that the change in medication regimen increases the risk of megaloblastic anemia). The S-type arguments correctly state that megaloblastic anemia is not associated with the medications in the regimen, but this contradicts the claim rather than supporting it. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
