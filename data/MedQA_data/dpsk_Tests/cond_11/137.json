Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications for why a lumbar puncture might be relevant given the patient's symptoms, but none of the S-type arguments' justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications. Additionally, the S-type arguments present reasons why a lumbar puncture might not be the best initial test, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
