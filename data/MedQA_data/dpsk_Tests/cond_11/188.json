Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide strong support for the claim that the patient is experiencing symptoms of acute dystonia, citing classic signs, timeline, and medication risk. However, the S-type arguments introduce counterpoints (symptoms not distressing, possible tardive dyskinesia) that are not semantic subsets of the P-type justifications and instead challenge the claim. Therefore, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are fully supported by the P-type arguments.
