Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications for the use of muscarinic antagonists in the given patient scenario, but none of the S-type arguments' justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type justifications. Additionally, the S-type arguments actually contradict the claim by suggesting that muscarinic antagonists are not first-line or optimal for pediatric allergic asthma with eosinophilia. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
