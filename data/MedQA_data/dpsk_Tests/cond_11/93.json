Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide strong support for 22q11 deletion syndrome as the likely cause, but the S-type arguments introduce counterpoints (absence of cyanosis, normal APGAR score, and lack of additional typical features) that challenge this diagnosis. These S-type arguments are not semantic subsets of the P-type justifications and instead provide independent reasons to doubt the claim, meaning not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are fully supported by the P-type arguments. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
