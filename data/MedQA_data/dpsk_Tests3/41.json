She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski\"s signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Interleukin-4 takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock.",
