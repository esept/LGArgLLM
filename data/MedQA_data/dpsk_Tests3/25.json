  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 2-year-old boy in respiratory distress is brought to the emergency department by his parents. They state that approximately one hour after putting their child to sleep, a \"hacking\" cough was heard from his bedroom. After entering his room the parents state their child appeared to be in distress, making a high pitched noise with every breath. Beyond a runny nose for the past few days, the child has been healthy. He has no toys in his bed or access to any other small objects. Physical exam demonstrates a 2-year-old child in respiratory distress.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The proper management for this patient is Dexamethasone, racemic epinephrine, and observation for 4 hours. If the stridor remits, the patient can be discharged.",
