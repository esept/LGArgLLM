Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing overlapping reasons that support the diagnosis of transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies. For example, the mother's history of Graves' disease and the newborn's symptoms are mentioned in multiple justifications, indicating shared semantic content.
