Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the use of Methylprednisolone for treating the patient's symptoms of facial nerve palsy. They overlap in their support for the claim by citing the drug's common use for such conditions, the patient's history with corticosteroids, and the match with the clinical presentation. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
