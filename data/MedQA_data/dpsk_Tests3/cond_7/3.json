Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the argument about obesity being a risk factor for osteoarthritis overlaps with the argument about excess weight causing mechanical stress on joints, as both relate to the impact of obesity on joint health. Similarly, the argument about the patient's family history of RA and the argument about early-morning stiffness both relate to the possibility of inflammatory arthritis. However, there are also arguments (e.g., about fatigue and sleep) that are disjoint from the others, as they address different aspects of the patient's condition. Since at least one pair of arguments is disjoint, the result is true.
