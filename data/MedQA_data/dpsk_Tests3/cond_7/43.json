Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the characteristics of melanocytic lesions, particularly melanoma, and how they present with variegated coloration (brown-black and red-white). Each justification contributes to supporting the claim by highlighting different aspects of melanoma (e.g., pathology, clinical features, risk factors), but they all overlap in their focus on the color variation observed in such lesions.
