Result: false
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to botulism and its mechanism of inhibiting neurotransmitter release (including GABA), which supports the claim. The justifications are not disjoint as they all refer to the same underlying cause (botulinum toxin) and its effects on neurotransmitter release.
