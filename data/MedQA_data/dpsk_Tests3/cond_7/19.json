Result: false
Justification: Both justifications for the arguments relate to the use of phenol as a disinfectant, with the first focusing on its mechanism of action (oxidizing and denaturing proteins) and the second on its historical use in laboratory settings. Since both justifications support the claim by referring to properties or uses of phenol, they are not semantically disjoint.
