Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the mechanism of action of chlorhexidine, specifically its pH-dependence and reduced efficacy in the presence of organic matter. They share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all discuss the same aspects of chlorhexidine's activity. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
