Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Some arguments support uterine artery ligation as the best next step (e.g., effectiveness in controlling hemorrhage, necessity in cases of significant bleeding), while others argue against it (e.g., preference for conservative management, first-line measures being manual removal and uterotonics). These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they present opposing views.
