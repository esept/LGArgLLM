Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are semantically related to the claim and overlap in meaning. They all discuss the role of CD8+ T lymphocytes in lysing abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation, and their recognition of class I major histocompatibility molecules. Since none of the justifications are disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false.
