Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss how CBT addresses specific aspects of the patient's condition (eating disorders and distorted body image), which are related to the claim. Similarly, the third and fifth arguments both mention the need for long-term management and a multidisciplinary approach, which overlap in their support for the claim. Thus, there are overlapping semantic subsets in the justifications.
