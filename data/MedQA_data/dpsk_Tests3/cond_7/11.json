Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint in some cases. For example, one argument discusses the presence of bilateral crackles and pitting edema (consistent with high BNP), while another discusses the oxygen saturation being normal (not strongly supporting severe heart failure). These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in their semantic contribution to the claim. Similarly, arguments about low potassium levels and blood pressure are also disjoint from others. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
