Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first two arguments focus on the classification of the study (cohort vs. case series) and the absence of risk calculation, while the third and fourth arguments discuss the study's design and focus (feasibility and outcomes), which do not directly overlap with the first two in terms of semantic contribution to the claim. Thus, at least one pair of arguments (e.g., the first and third) has disjoint justifications.
