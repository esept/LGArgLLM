Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. All arguments discuss the role of TNF-alpha in macrophage activation, phagosome-lysosome fusion, NO production, and tubercle formation during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Since none of the pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint, the result is false.
