Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason for performing a contrast enema (e.g., diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease, investigating clinical signs, assessing mechanical obstruction, or considering an abdominal X-ray first). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to supporting the claim.
