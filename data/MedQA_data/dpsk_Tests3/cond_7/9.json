Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, with overlapping references to the patient's history of valve replacement, fever, and peripheral signs like splinter hemorrhages. They also consistently emphasize the importance of identifying valve abnormalities (friable irregular masses) for diagnosis. Thus, no pair of arguments has semantically disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
