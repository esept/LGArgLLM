Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are semantically related to the claim and to each other. They all discuss the likelihood of Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) given the observed anomalies (microcephaly, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, ventricular septal defect, etc.) and how this condition is associated with a prominent occiput. Since none of the justifications are disjoint in their semantic content with respect to the claim, the result is false.
