Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite against picornaviruses, with the first mentioning its broad-spectrum efficacy and the second detailing its mechanism of action. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments also overlap in discussing the conditions under which sodium hypochlorite is effective and its recommendations by health organizations. Therefore, there is semantic overlap among the justifications.
