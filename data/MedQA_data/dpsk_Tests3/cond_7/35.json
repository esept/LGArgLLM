Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the consistency of symptoms with a mild soft tissue injury, while another raises concern for a scaphoid fracture requiring specific imaging. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
