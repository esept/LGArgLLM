Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the same underlying point: that VDJ recombination is not relevant to the scenario described because it is specific to adaptive immune responses (B and T lymphocytes) and not the innate immune response likely involved in the patient's condition. Thus, the justifications are not semantically disjoint; they all support the claim by explaining why VDJ recombination does not apply in this context.
