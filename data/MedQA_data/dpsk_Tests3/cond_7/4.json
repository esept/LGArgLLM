Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All arguments share a common semantic subset related to the use of sodium bicarbonate for tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose, evidenced by the widened QRS complex, clinical symptoms consistent with TCA toxicity, and adherence to clinical guidelines. Each justification reinforces the others by providing overlapping reasons for the appropriateness of sodium bicarbonate in this scenario.
