  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 25-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by her family. They found her somnolent next to her computer and scattered pill bottles over two hours ago. The family cannot recall the types of pill bottles that they found and did not bring them to the ED. The patient\"s past medical history is notable for anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She is currently not on any medications other than an exercise program with which she is non-compliant. A physical exam is performed and is within normal limits. The patient begins communicating with the physician and states that she did take acetaminophen but it was only a few pills. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 82/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mmHg, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The next step in management is to check the blood acetaminophen levels.",
