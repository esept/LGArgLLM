  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 2-day-old infant male is brought to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of vomiting and irritability. He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient\"s symptoms.",
