Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core centered around the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies from the mother (with Graves' disease) to the newborn, leading to neonatal hyperthyroidism. The justifications consistently reference the mother's history, the newborn's symptoms, and the absence of alternative causes, all supporting the same underlying mechanism for the claim.
