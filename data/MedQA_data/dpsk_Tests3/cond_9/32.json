Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim about chlorhexidine's mechanism of action being pH-dependent and reduced by organic matter. Each justification mentions either the pH-dependency, the effect of organic matter, or both, aligning with the claim's description of chlorhexidine's activity.
