Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments mention bacterial adaptation in binding proteins (e.g., altered PBPs in Staphylococcus), others propose unrelated mechanisms like biofilm formation or incorrect antibiotic choice. There is no single intersection of meaning across all justifications that supports the claim.
