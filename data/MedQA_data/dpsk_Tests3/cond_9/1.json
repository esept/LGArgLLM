Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification points to specific symptoms (symmetric flaccid weakness, diminished reflexes, bell-shaped chest, weak cry/suck) and clinical features (onset at 6 months, progressive weakness, spared extraocular/facial muscles) that are classic for anterior horn cell degeneration, particularly spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The justifications collectively reinforce the same underlying diagnosis.
