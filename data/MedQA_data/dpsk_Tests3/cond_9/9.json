Result: true  
Justification: All the provided arguments share a common semantic core related to infective endocarditis as the likely diagnosis, supported by the patient's history of valve replacement, fever, systemic symptoms, and peripheral signs like splinter hemorrhages. The justifications consistently point to the diagnostic relevance of friable irregular masses on the valve, which are a hallmark of infective endocarditis and a major criterion in the Duke criteria. Thus, there is a clear intersection in the semantic basis of all arguments supporting the claim.
