Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments support reassurance and pain management (e.g., mild soft tissue injury, absence of severe symptoms), others suggest the need for further diagnostic steps (e.g., possible fracture or scaphoid fracture requiring imaging). These differing recommendations indicate no shared semantic basis across all justifications.
