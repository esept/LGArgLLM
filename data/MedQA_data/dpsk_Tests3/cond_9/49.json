Result: false  
Justification: While all arguments support the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for long-term management of the patient's condition, they do not share a single semantic core. Some arguments focus on CBT's effectiveness for eating disorders and distorted body image, while others highlight the need for immediate medical intervention or a multidisciplinary approach. The justifications diverge in their emphasis, indicating no common intersection across all arguments.
