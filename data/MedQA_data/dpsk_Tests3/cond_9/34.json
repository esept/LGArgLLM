Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that decreased adiposity leads to reduced estrogen production (hypoestrogenemia) due to the role of adipose tissue in estrogen synthesis. Each justification supports this mechanism, whether by referencing the patient's weight loss, clinical presentation, or general physiological principles linking body fat to estrogen levels.
