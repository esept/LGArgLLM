Result: true  
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification relates to the effectiveness of Cilostazol in treating symptoms of intermittent claudication or peripheral arterial disease, which aligns with the patient's described condition (left calf pain when walking, history of smoking and diabetes, etc.). The justifications collectively reinforce the appropriateness of Cilostazol for this patient's symptoms.
