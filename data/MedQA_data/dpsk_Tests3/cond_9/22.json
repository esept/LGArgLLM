Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that uterine artery ligation is the best next step in management. Some arguments support it as an effective measure in controlling postpartum hemorrhage when conservative measures fail, while others argue that conservative management with monitoring and uterotonics is preferred over immediate surgical intervention. The justifications are not aligned in supporting the claim uniformly.
