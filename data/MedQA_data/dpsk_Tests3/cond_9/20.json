Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. While some arguments support the effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite against picornaviruses, others introduce variability in effectiveness based on concentration and contact time, or suggest that other disinfectants may be more effective under specific conditions. This lack of a consistent, shared basis means there is no common intersection of all justifications supporting the claim.
