Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While three arguments support the immediate use of a contrast enema for diagnosing conditions like Hirschsprung's disease or mechanical obstruction, one argument suggests obtaining an abdominal X-ray first, which introduces a divergence in the recommended next step. This lack of unanimity means there is no shared semantic basis across all justifications.
