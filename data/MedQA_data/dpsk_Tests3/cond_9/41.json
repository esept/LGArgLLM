Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments suggest IL-4 plays a role in septic shock by promoting inflammatory pathways (e.g., enhancing TNF-alpha and IL-6), others highlight its regulatory or anti-inflammatory role (e.g., counteracting hyperinflammation). There is no consistent intersection in meaning across all justifications to support the claim uniformly.
