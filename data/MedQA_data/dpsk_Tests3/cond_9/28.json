Result: true  
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic core that links the observed fetal anomalies (microcephaly, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, ventricular septal defect, etc.) to Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), which is known to be associated with a prominent occiput. Each justification reinforces this connection, making the collective support for the claim consistent and unified.
