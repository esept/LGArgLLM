Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first and second arguments focus on diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease and the clinical signs warranting a contrast enema, respectively, while the third argument suggests obtaining an abdominal X-ray first, which introduces a different reasoning pattern. The fourth argument aligns with the first two but does not overlap with the third. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
