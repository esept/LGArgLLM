Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on different clinical features (e.g., symmetric flaccid weakness, diminished reflexes, bell-shaped chest, weak cry and suck, spared extraocular muscles) that collectively support the diagnosis of anterior horn cell degeneration, specifically spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The justifications consistently reference the alignment of these features with SMA, indicating a common underlying reasoning pattern.
