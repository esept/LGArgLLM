Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common idea that sodium bicarbonate is the appropriate treatment for tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose, specifically in this patient's case. The justifications overlap in mentioning the widened QRS complex, symptoms consistent with TCA toxicity, the mechanism of sodium bicarbonate (alkalinization of blood), clinical guidelines, and the patient's history of nortriptyline use. Each argument reinforces the others by providing complementary reasons supporting the use of sodium bicarbonate.
