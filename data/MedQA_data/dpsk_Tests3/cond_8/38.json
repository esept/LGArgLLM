Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that cilostazol is an effective treatment for the patient's symptoms of intermittent claudication, which is likely due to peripheral arterial disease. The justifications overlap in their reasoning about the patient's risk factors (smoking, diabetes) and the FDA-approved use of cilostazol for this condition. Each argument supports the claim by linking cilostazol's mechanism or efficacy to the patient's specific symptoms and risk profile.
