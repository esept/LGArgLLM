Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first justification focuses on the specificity of VDJ recombination to B and T lymphocytes, the second on the clinical presentation suggesting bacterial pneumonia, and the third on the expected involvement of VDJ recombination if the protein were an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. These are distinct points without overlapping semantic content.
