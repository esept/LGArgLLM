Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The arguments consistently focus on the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating eating disorders like anorexia nervosa, addressing distorted body image, and the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Each argument reinforces the relevance of CBT for the patient's condition, either by highlighting its evidence-based nature, its focus on maladaptive thoughts, or its role in long-term management alongside other interventions. The semantic overlap is clear across all pairs, as they all relate to CBT's applicability and effectiveness for the patient's described symptoms and needs.
