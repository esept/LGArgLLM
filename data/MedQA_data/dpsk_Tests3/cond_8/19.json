Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that phenol is a disinfectant with properties (oxidizing and denaturing proteins) that match the described mechanism of action in the claim. The first argument explicitly states this alignment, while the second argument supports it by noting phenol's historical use in similar contexts. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
