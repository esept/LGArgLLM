Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that decreased adiposity leads to reduced estrogen production (hypoestrogenemia) in the patient. Each justification emphasizes the role of adipose tissue in estrogen synthesis and connects the patient's weight loss, decreased adiposity, and clinical presentation to hypoestrogenemia. The semantic overlap is clear across all pairs of arguments.
