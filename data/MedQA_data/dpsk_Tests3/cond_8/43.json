Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that melanocytic lesions, particularly melanomas, exhibit variegated or irregular coloration (brown-black and red-white) due to malignant transformation, uneven melanin distribution, or progression of the lesion. Each justification relates this color variation to the clinical and pathological context of the claim, ensuring semantic overlap between all pairs.
