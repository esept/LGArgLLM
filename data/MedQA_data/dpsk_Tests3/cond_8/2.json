Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common idea that CD8+ T lymphocytes are the immune cells described in the claim due to their ability to lyse abnormal cells without opsonization, priming, or prior activation, and their interaction with class I major histocompatibility molecules. Each argument reinforces this central point with slightly different emphases, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
