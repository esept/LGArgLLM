Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite in inactivating viruses, particularly picornaviruses. The justifications discuss its broad-spectrum efficacy, mechanism of action (disrupting protein coats and nucleic acids), variability based on conditions, and recommendations by health organizations. These overlapping ideas collectively support the claim about sodium hypochlorite being the most effective disinfectant for the given virus.
