Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. Some arguments support uterine artery ligation as the best next step (e.g., effectiveness in controlling hemorrhage, necessity in cases of significant bleeding), while others argue against it (e.g., preference for conservative management, first-line management should be manual removal and uterotonics). These opposing viewpoints do not share common ideas or reasoning patterns in their justifications.
