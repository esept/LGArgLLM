Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not all share a common semantic intersection. While some arguments (e.g., the first and second) overlap in discussing the lack of risk calculation and the appropriateness of a case series, the third argument introduces a different perspective by suggesting the prospective design could justify a cohort study label. The fourth argument further diverges by focusing on the study's aim (feasibility and outcomes) rather than the classification issue. Thus, not all pairs of arguments share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
