He states that he received all of his recommended vaccinations prior to beginning college, but has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years. His medical history is significant for intermittent, exercise-induced asthma. He has been sexually active in the past with multiple female partners.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: In addition to an influenza vaccine, the meningococcal vaccine should be administered to this patient during this visit.",
