  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 39-year-old woman presents to the clinic for her annual physical. Although she feels generally healthy she has noticed gaining about 9 kg (20 lb) over the last year. She eats a healthy, varied diet and exercises at the gym 4 days a week, including 20 minutes of aerobic exercise. On further questioning, she has also noted fatigue and constipation. She denies shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or blood in her stool. At the clinic, the vital signs include: pulse 52/min, blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable only for slightly dry skin. The complete blood count (CBC) is within normal limits.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is most likely elevated.",
