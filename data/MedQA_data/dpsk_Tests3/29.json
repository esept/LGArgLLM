  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 23-year-old man presents with sudden loss of consciousness while pitching in a baseball game. There is no history of injury. Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse. There are no audible murmurs. An S4 is present.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
