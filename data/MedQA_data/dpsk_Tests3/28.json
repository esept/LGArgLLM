  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 38-year-old G4P3 presents to her obstetrician\u2019s office for her 20-week anatomy ultrasound. She reports that she feels well and has not experienced any contractions or vaginal bleeding. She also reports good fetal movement. The patient declined prenatal screening earlier in the pregnancy for religious reasons but would now like an anatomy ultrasound to ensure the fetus is growing appropriately. The patient\u2019s previous pregnancies were uncomplicated, and she delivered three healthy babies at full term. On the ultrasound, the technician observes a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). She also notes microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The technician further notes a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is 26 cm.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: A prominent occiput is most likely to be observed in this fetus.",
