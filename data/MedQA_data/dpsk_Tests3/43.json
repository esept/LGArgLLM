  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 52-year-old fisherman presents to the clinic for an evaluation of a pigmented lesion on his neck. He states that he first noticed the lesion last year, but he believes that it has been slowly growing in size. Dermatopathology determines that the lesion contains neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: A brown-black color in one area and red-white in a different area of the lesion would likely be observed on physical examination.",
