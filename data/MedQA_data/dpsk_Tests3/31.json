  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother 30 minutes after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria. The symptoms began 5 minutes after she ate a peanut butter sandwich. Her respirations are 36/min and blood pressure is 84/50 mm Hg. There is stridor on auscultation of the chest. She is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and the appropriate pharmacotherapy are begun.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The drug administered to this patient most likely increases Ca2+ influx in phase 4 on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential.",
