  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 28-year-old woman presents with facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea for the past month. She denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. The patient was on a trip to Thailand 2 years ago with her family but denies any recent travel. Her blood pressure is 120/88 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, except for a potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L and serum calcium of 11 mg/dL. The attending physician suspects that this might be a case of a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 and orders a genetic analysis.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely diagnosis in this patient is VIPoma.",
