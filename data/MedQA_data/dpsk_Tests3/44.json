  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the hospital because of poor weight gain since birth. He was born at 38 weeks\" gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves\" disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient\"s temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely cause is the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies.",
