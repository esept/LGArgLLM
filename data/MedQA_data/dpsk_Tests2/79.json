  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: If taken in high doses, the most likely side effects of the drug are headache and tinnitus.",
