  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 64-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a complaint of bilateral knee pain that has been present for the past several years but has worsened recently. He reports pain with climbing stairs and with extended walks of greater than 100 yards. The pain worsens with activity throughout the day and is alleviated by periods of rest. He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: No further work-up is needed for this patient\"s presenting condition based on the patient\"s presenting condition.",
