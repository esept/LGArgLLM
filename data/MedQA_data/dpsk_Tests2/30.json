  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of unusual behavior that started 3 hours ago while he was at a party. He has a history of major depressive disorder and seasonal allergies. His mother has a history of anxiety. He drinks 5 beers on the weekends. Current medications include amitriptyline and diphenhydramine. The patient does not respond to questions and repeatedly says, \"\"The government is following me everywhere.\"\" His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 160/89 mm Hg. He is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to place or time. Neurologic examination shows dilated pupils bilaterally and diffuse hyperreflexia. His feet are cold, and capillary refill time is 3 seconds. After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely explanation for this patient\"s symptoms is synthetic cathinone intoxication.",
