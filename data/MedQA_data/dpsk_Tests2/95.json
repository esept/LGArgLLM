  "claim": "Consider the following background information: An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of headaches for the past 2 weeks. His headaches tend to occur in the morning and are associated with nausea and vomiting. One month ago, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of fever, irritability, and neck rigidity, and he was successfully treated with antibiotics. His temperature today is 37.5\u00b0C (98.5\u00b0F). An MRI of the brain shows bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations is the most likely explanation of the patient\"s condition.",
