  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 61-year-old man comes to the physician with several months of sharp, shooting pain in both legs. Twenty years ago, he had a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment. He has no history of serious illness. Examination shows small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the distal lower extremities. Patellar reflexes are absent bilaterally. His gait is unsteady and broad-based.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: This patient is at increased risk for developing Atrioventricular block.",
