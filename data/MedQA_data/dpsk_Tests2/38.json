  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 63-year-old man presents to the clinic for left calf pain when walking a distance of more than 200 m. He has had this pain for more than 8 months now, and he rates it as 7 out of 10. The pain subsides with rest. The patient has had a history of diabetes mellitus for the past 2 years which is well controlled. A percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 2014. His current medications are insulin and aspirin. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease. He has an 80 pack-year history of smoking and currently smokes. He consumes 4 drinks per day of alcohol. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 144/89 mm Hg, the heart rate is 80/min and regular, the breathing rate is 25/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. Normal cardiac and lung sounds were heard on auscultation.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Cilostazol is the appropriate treatment to improve the patient\"s symptoms.",
