Endometrial cells obtained from study participants are plated on growth media and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured with flow cytometry. Drug X, which is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, is administered to all the cells, and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured again 1 hour later.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Initiation of S phase is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene.",
