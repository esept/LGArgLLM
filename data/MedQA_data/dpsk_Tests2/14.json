  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 61-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of abdominal pain and constipation. He reports a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain. He has had one small bowel movement in 4 days. Normally he has a bowel movement once a day. His medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 beers per day. His diet consists primarily of fast food. His temperature is 101.8\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient\u2019s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: This patient\"s condition is most strongly associated with Menetrier disease.",
