Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the patient's symptoms (chronic diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia) and their alignment with VIPoma, as well as the suspicion of MEN1 and its association with VIPoma. These overlaps indicate that the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
