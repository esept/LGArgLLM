Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the arguments about the patient's symptoms (fever, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal mass) and the arguments about the recommended treatment (intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline) both relate to the diagnosis of PID and the need for specific treatment. There is significant overlap in their semantic content with respect to supporting the claim.
