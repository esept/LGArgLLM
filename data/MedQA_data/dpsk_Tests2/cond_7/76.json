Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by discussing how the patient's symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, hypovolemia, etc.) and the Darrow-Yannet diagram indicate volume depletion, which in turn is associated with increased BNP secretion. The arguments share overlapping semantic content in supporting the claim.
