Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to deficiencies in components of the immune system (complement system, C3, properdin, antibodies) that act as opsonins and explain the patient's susceptibility to infections with encapsulated bacteria. Since all justifications share a common semantic theme (opsonin deficiency leading to recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria), none of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
