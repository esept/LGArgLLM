Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the role of TNF-alpha in the context of Th1-mediated immune responses, specifically its secretion by Th1 cells, its role in macrophage activation, phagosome-lysosome fusion, NO production, and tubercle formation. Since all justifications share a common semantic subset (the functions and effects of TNF-alpha in the described immune response), none of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
