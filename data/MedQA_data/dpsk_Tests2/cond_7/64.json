Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument focuses on distinct developmental milestones for each of the three children (1-month-old, 4-month-old, and 9-month-old), and there is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim. For example, the first child's milestones (lifting head, tracking objects) are distinct from the second child's milestones (rolling, transferring rattle) and the third child's milestones (taking steps, recognizing objects). Thus, all pairs of arguments are disjoint.
