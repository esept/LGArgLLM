Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the patient's history of acute pancreatitis and current abdominal findings to support pancreatic fluid leakage, while the second argument emphasizes the hepatitis C infection and laboratory findings to suggest decompensated liver cirrhosis. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
