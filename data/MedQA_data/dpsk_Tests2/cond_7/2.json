Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically as they all refer to CD8+ T lymphocytes and their role in lysing abnormal cells, particularly in the context of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Since none of the pairs of arguments have disjoint justifications with respect to the claim, the result is false.
