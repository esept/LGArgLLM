Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason for why an ACE inhibitor is the best initial management for the patient's condition, without overlapping in their semantic content. The first argument focuses on the need for antihypertensive therapy, the second on renoprotective effects, the third on improving adherence, and the fourth on cautious use due to age and history. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
