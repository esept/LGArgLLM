Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the patient's symptoms and history being consistent with tertiary syphilis or neurosyphilis, which in turn increases the risk of atrioventricular block. For example, the presence of Argyll Robertson pupils, sensory deficits, and an unsteady gait all point to neurosyphilis, which is a common theme across the justifications. Therefore, the justifications share overlapping semantic content with respect to the claim.
