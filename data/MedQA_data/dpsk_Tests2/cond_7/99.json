Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the diagnosis of osteoarthritis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, and they collectively support the claim that no further work-up is needed. Each argument provides overlapping or complementary reasons (e.g., classic symptoms, absence of red flags, age and history, lack of inflammatory signs, mechanical pain pattern, and specificity of findings) that contribute to the same conclusion. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are entirely disjoint with respect to the claim.
