Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset in their justifications, as they all relate the observed features (microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and VSD) to Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), which is associated with a prominent occiput. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
