Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing overlapping reasons that support impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations as the explanation for the patient's condition. For example, the history of meningitis, the symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, and the MRI findings all contribute to the same conclusion, indicating shared semantic subsets.
