Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the claim by providing reasons why a contrast enema is the best next step in management. They overlap in meaning as they all discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic value of a contrast enema in the context of Hirschsprung disease, bowel obstruction, and the patient's specific clinical presentation. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
