Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both relate to high BNP levels due to fluid overload and heart failure, respectively. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both discuss the role of ADH in fluid retention and its impact on sodium levels. These overlaps indicate shared semantic subsets contributing to the support of the claim.
