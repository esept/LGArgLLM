Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the patient's early-onset colon disease and family history as evidence for an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (e.g., arguments about hereditary conditions like FAP or Lynch syndrome). These justifications share common semantic elements (e.g., family history, early onset) that contribute to the claim, so they are not disjoint.
