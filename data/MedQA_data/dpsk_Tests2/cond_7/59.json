Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing different clinical manifestations and reasoning that collectively support the conclusion of defective T cell function. Each justification adds a unique but related aspect to the argument, such as ruling out HIV, describing symptoms like oral candidiasis and failure to thrive, and linking recurrent infections to T-cell immunodeficiency. Thus, they share a common semantic subset that contributes to supporting the claim.
