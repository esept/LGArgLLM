Result: false
Justification: Both arguments (P-type) share a common semantic subset related to the use of epinephrine for treating anaphylaxis, which supports the claim about the drug's mechanism of action. The first argument directly states that epinephrine increases Ca2+ influx in cardiac pacemaker cells, while the second argument supports the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, which is treated with epinephrine. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
