Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by discussing how obesity (excess weight) is linked to the patient's knee pain and other complaints, either through mechanical stress, degenerative changes, or the effectiveness of weight loss as a treatment. There is significant overlap in their semantic content supporting the claim.
