Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing overlapping reasons that support the diagnosis of plague. For example, multiple arguments mention the patient's symptoms (e.g., severe dyspnea, productive cough with blood, high fever, confusion, painful inguinal swelling) and the patient's recent exposure to an endemic region for plague. These justifications share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is disjoint.
