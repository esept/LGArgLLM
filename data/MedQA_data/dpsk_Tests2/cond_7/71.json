Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the role of calcium ion efflux in myocyte relaxation. They all discuss how calcium efflux is necessary for terminating contraction, lowering cytoplasmic calcium concentration, and allowing the myocyte to relax. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
