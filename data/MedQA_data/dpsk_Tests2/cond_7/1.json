Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments provided are not semantically disjoint. For example, the arguments about the patient's symptoms (e.g., symmetric flaccid weakness, bell-shaped chest, weak cry/suck) and the progressive nature of the symptoms all relate to the claim that anterior horn cell degeneration is the most likely cause. These justifications overlap in their support for the claim by referencing consistent clinical findings and ruling out other disorders. Therefore, there is at least one pair of arguments whose justifications are not disjoint.
