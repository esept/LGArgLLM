Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments relate to the concept of projection as a psychological defense mechanism and how the man's actions align with this concept. They share a common semantic subset in discussing projection, its definition, and its application to the man's behavior. Therefore, none of the pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
