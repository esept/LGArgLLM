Result: false
Justification: All the arguments provided share a common semantic subset related to the need for compression ultrasonography to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the given clinical scenario. Each argument supports the claim by addressing different aspects of the patient's condition and the rationale for using compression ultrasonography, but they all converge on the same underlying justification for the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
