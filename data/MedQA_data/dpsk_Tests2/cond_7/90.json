Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the preservation and transport of the amputated finger. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss methods to preserve the finger (ice water vs. dry and on ice), and the third argument emphasizes the importance of preservation methods. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
