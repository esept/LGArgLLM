Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to different symptoms or behaviors that are characteristic of borderline personality disorder, such as emotional dysregulation, self-harm, substance abuse, unstable relationships, impulsive aggression, and fear of abandonment. These justifications overlap in their support for the claim by collectively pointing to features of borderline personality disorder.
