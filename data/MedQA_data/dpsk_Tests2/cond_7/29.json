Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to different aspects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (e.g., symptoms, physical findings, heart sounds, patient history) that collectively support the claim. There is overlap in their contributions to the diagnosis, as they all point to features consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
