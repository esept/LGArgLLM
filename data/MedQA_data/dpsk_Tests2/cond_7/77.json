Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the increased production of nitric oxide as the explanation for decreased arginine concentrations in vascular endothelial cells. Each justification supports the claim by linking different aspects of the patient's condition (e.g., hypertension treatment, temporal arteritis, symptoms) to the same underlying mechanism (increased nitric oxide production). Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
