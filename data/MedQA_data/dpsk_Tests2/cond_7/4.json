Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are related to the use of sodium bicarbonate in treating tricyclic antidepressant overdose, specifically addressing the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. They all share a common semantic subset that supports the claim, focusing on the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate in counteracting the toxic effects of nortriptyline, as evidenced by the patient's condition. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
