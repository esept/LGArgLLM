Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap semantically in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the patient's normal secondary sexual characteristics and hormone levels (A1, A4, A5), the absence of abnormalities in the pelvic ultrasound (A2, A5), and the exclusion of other causes like excessive exercise or endocrine disorders (A3, A4, A5). These justifications share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim, so they are not disjoint.
