Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim that the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a 22q11 deletion. Each justification relates to different aspects of the clinical presentation (e.g., VSD, feeding difficulties, commonality of the syndrome, absence of cyanosis) but all converge on the same conclusion. Therefore, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
