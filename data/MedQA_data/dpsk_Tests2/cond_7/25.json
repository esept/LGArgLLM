Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the justification for the first argument ("The symptoms described... are consistent with croup") overlaps with the justification for the seventh argument ("The recent runny nose suggests a viral upper respiratory infection..."). Both relate to the diagnosis of croup based on symptoms and history. Similarly, other arguments share common semantic subsets related to the management and diagnosis of croup. Thus, there is semantic overlap among the justifications.
