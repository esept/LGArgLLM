Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset in their justifications, which is the need for a CT angiogram due to the patient's symptoms, history, and risk factors. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to supporting the claim by emphasizing different aspects of the patient's condition that warrant a CT angiogram.
