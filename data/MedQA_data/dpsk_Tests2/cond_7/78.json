Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments relate to the diagnosis of a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain, with overlapping points about the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the absence of severe injury indicators. Therefore, there is a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim.
