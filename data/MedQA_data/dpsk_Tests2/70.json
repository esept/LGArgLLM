  "claim": "Consider the following background information: Three days after undergoing a laparoscopic Whipple\"s procedure, a 43-year-old woman has swelling of her right leg. She does not have pain. She has nausea but has not vomited. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 1 month ago. She has been using an incentive spirometer every 6 hours since recovering from her surgery. Prior to admission, her only medications were a multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows mild swelling of the right thigh to the ankle; there is no erythema or pitting edema. Homan\"s sign is negative. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. There are five abdominal laparoscopic incisions with no erythema or discharge. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Compression ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management.",
