  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 26-year-old man presents to his physician with a history of diarrhea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9\u00baC (98.4\u00baF), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 102/74 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. A resident working under the physician plots a Darrow-Yannet diagram for the patient. The diagram is shown in the picture where the green dotted line represents the new fluid status.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: B-type natriuretic peptide is most likely to show increased secretion in this patient.",
