  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: CD8+ T lymphocytes are the class of immune cells that best describe the cells mentioned.",
