Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that gag gene mutations can cause resistance to antiretroviral drugs, leading to treatment failure in HIV-positive patients on HAART. Each justification relates this mechanism to the patient's elevated viral load and low CD4 count, indicating a consistent overlap in semantic content supporting the claim.
