Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the patient's early-onset colon disease and family history strongly suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Each argument either directly references hereditary conditions (e.g., FAP, Lynch syndrome) or the patient's family history and early symptoms, which are consistent with autosomal dominant disorders. Thus, all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
