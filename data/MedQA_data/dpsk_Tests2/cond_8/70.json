Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that compression ultrasonography is necessary to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the given clinical context. Each argument provides different supporting reasons (e.g., post-surgery risk, absence of pain not ruling out DVT, non-invasive nature of the test), but all ultimately converge on the need for compression ultrasonography as the next step in management.
