Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that TNF-alpha, secreted by Th1 cells, is responsible for the described actions (phagosome-lysosome fusion, macrophage activation, NO production, and tubercle formation). Each argument overlaps in supporting this central idea, either by directly stating TNF-alpha's role or by referencing its documented effects in immunological mechanisms.
