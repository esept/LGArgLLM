Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that a deficiency in a component of the immune system (complement system, C3, properdin, or antibodies like IgG) that acts as an opsonin explains the patient's susceptibility to infections with encapsulated bacteria. Each argument's justification overlaps semantically with the others by focusing on the role of opsonins in immune defense against encapsulated bacteria, which is central to the claim.
