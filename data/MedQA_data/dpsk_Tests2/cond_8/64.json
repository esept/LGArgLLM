Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. Each argument focuses on distinct developmental milestones specific to different ages (1 month, 4 months, and 9 months), and there is no overlap in their justifications that directly relates to the claim about the patients' ages being represented as 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months.
