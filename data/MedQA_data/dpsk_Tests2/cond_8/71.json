Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that calcium ion efflux is necessary for myocyte relaxation, either by terminating the contraction cycle, actively pumping calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, preventing sustained contraction, lowering cytoplasmic calcium concentration, or facilitating efflux through specific mechanisms. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
