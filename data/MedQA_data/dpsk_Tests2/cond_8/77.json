Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument connects the decreased arginine concentrations to increased nitric oxide production, either through the role of arginine as a substrate for nitric oxide synthase, the effects of lisinopril on nitric oxide bioavailability, the vascular inflammation from temporal arteritis, the symptoms of blurry vision and headache, or the vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide in hypertension. These connections ensure that every pair of arguments has at least one common idea supporting the claim.
