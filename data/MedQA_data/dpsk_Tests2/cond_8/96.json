Result: true
Justification: All arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim, as they all discuss various symptoms and contextual factors (e.g., geographic exposure, rapid progression of symptoms) that collectively support the diagnosis of plague. Each pair of arguments references at least one common idea, such as the presence of bubonic or pneumonic plague symptoms, the patient's recent exposure to an endemic area, or the absence of alternative explanations.
