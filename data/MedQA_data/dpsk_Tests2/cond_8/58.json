Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided all support the claim that the most likely diagnosis is a vaginal septum, but they do not share overlapping semantic justifications. Each argument presents a distinct piece of evidence or reasoning (e.g., normal secondary sexual characteristics, normal hormone levels, absence of abnormalities in pelvic ultrasound, history of competitive ice skating, family history of normal menarche, normal laboratory values) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning or reasoning pattern.
