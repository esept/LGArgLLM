Justification: All the arguments share the common idea that a sputum culture is a useful diagnostic tool for identifying or ruling out bacterial infections in the context of the patient's persistent cough and blood-tinged sputum. Each argument emphasizes different aspects of this main idea, such as the ability to identify pathogens, the standard use in persistent symptoms, or the non-invasive nature of the test, but they all overlap semantically in supporting the claim that a sputum culture is the best next step in management.
