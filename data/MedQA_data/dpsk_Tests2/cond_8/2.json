Justification: All arguments share the common idea that CD8+ T lymphocytes are the immune cells responsible for lysing abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation, as described in the background information. The justifications all refer to the role of CD8+ T lymphocytes in recognizing and lysing abnormal cells, particularly in the context of class I MHC molecules, which is the central theme of the claim.
