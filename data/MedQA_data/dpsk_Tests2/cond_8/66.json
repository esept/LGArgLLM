Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that drug X's activation of CDK4 leads to phosphorylation of the Rb protein, which in turn releases E2F transcription factors and promotes the initiation of S phase. This core mechanism is consistently referenced across all justifications, ensuring semantic overlap between every pair of arguments.
