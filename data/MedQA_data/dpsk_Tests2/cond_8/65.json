Result: true
Justification: All arguments share common semantic justifications related to the claim that sickle cell disease is the most likely cause of the patient's condition. Each argument either directly references classic symptoms of sickle cell disease (e.g., jaundice, normocytic anemia, severe bone pain), diagnostic features (e.g., elongated and curved cells on peripheral blood smear), or supporting evidence (e.g., elevated reticulocyte count, African American ethnicity, history of recurrent bone pain). The overlap in these justifications ensures that every pair of arguments shares at least one common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
