Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis, a condition typically diagnosed clinically without the need for further work-up. Each argument reinforces this idea by highlighting different aspects of the patient's presentation (e.g., absence of red flags, chronic pain pattern, age, physical exam findings) that collectively support the conclusion that no further work-up is needed.
