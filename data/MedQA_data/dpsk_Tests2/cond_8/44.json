Result: true
Justification: All arguments share a common semantic justification related to the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies from the mother with Graves' disease to the newborn, leading to neonatal hyperthyroidism. Each argument either directly references this mechanism or supports it by describing the clinical presentation, maternal history, or the pathophysiology of the condition. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justification regarding the claim.
