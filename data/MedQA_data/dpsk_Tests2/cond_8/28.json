Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common idea that the observed features (microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, VSD, and IUGR) are consistent with Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), which is associated with a prominent occiput. Each argument reinforces this central point by highlighting different aspects of the condition or its typical features, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
