Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common idea of explaining the lymphatic and hematogenous spread of ovarian cancer to distant organs like the brain. Each justification discusses a part of the pathway (sentinel node, thoracic duct, left subclavian vein, systemic circulation) or the general mechanism (lymphatic system, hematogenous spread), ensuring semantic overlap in their support for the claim.
