Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the patient's obesity is the underlying cause of his knee pain and related symptoms. Each argument either directly states this or provides supporting evidence (e.g., obesity as a risk factor for osteoarthritis, mechanical stress on joints, or the effectiveness of weight loss as treatment). The semantic overlap is clear across all pairs of arguments.
