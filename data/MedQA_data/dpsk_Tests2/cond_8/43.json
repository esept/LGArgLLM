Justification: All arguments share the common idea that melanocytic neoplasms (as indicated by the dermatopathology findings) are associated with color variegation (brown-black and red-white areas) on physical examination. Each justification relates to this core concept, either by describing the typical features of melanocytic lesions, linking the pathology to clinical observations, or connecting the patient's history to the expected presentation.
