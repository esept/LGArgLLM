Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common semantic justification that sodium channel blockers (specifically class I anti-arrhythmic drugs) are known to cause neurological side effects such as headache and tinnitus at high doses. Each argument reiterates this core idea, either by focusing on the drug's mechanism of action (sodium channel blockade) or by emphasizing the dose-dependent nature of these side effects. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their semantic justifications with respect to the claim.
