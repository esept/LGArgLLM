  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 29-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit. She wishes to become pregnant within the next several months. A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL).\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Her current phenylalanine levels do not pose a risk to any future pregnancy.",
