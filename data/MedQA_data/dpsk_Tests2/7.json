  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s presentation is caused by the inhibition of GABA release.",
