He is asked by the surgeon to disinfect the patient\u2019s skin with a chlorhexidine-isopropyl alcohol solution before the procedure. Recent studies have shown that this solution substantially reduces the risk of surgical site infections compared with a povidone-iodine preparation without alcohol in clean-contaminated surgery.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The mechanism of action of chlorhexidine is best described by its activity depending on pH and being greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter.",
