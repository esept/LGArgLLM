  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 61-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Her last Pap smear 3 years ago showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. HPV testing was negative at that time. On questioning, she has had fatigue and an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease and Hashimoto\"s thyroiditis. Menarche was at the age of 10 years and her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. Current medications include omeprazole and levothyroxine. Abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. There is tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound. Bimanual palpation shows a small uterus and a right adnexal mass.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show the finding of proliferation of endometrial glands.",
