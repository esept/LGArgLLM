Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core supporting the claim that cilostazol is the appropriate treatment for the patient's symptoms. They collectively highlight cilostazol's mechanism of action (improving blood flow), its FDA approval for intermittent claudication (which matches the patient's symptoms), the patient's risk factors for peripheral arterial disease (justifying the treatment choice), clinical evidence of efficacy, and the patient's suitability for the therapy (no contraindications, potential additional benefits). The arguments consistently reinforce the appropriateness of cilostazol for this specific patient.
