Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim that compression ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management. The justifications consistently emphasize the need to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's unilateral leg swelling, recent surgery, and immobility, despite the absence of certain symptoms like pain or erythema. The arguments collectively reinforce the necessity and appropriateness of compression ultrasonography as the initial diagnostic test for DVT in this clinical scenario.
