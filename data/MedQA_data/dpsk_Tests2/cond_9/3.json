Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that the patient's excess weight (obesity) is the underlying cause of his knee pain and related symptoms. The justifications consistently link obesity to mechanical stress on joints, degenerative changes (osteoarthritis), and the patient's clinical presentation (pain, stiffness, crepitus). The arguments also reinforce that weight loss is a recommended intervention, further supporting obesity as the primary cause.
