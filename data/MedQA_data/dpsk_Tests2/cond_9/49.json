Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification emphasizes the effectiveness of Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa, by addressing distorted self-perception, maladaptive behaviors, and cognitive distortions. The arguments collectively highlight CBT as a first-line intervention for long-term management, aligning with the patient's symptoms and refusal of care. This shared focus on CBT's role in treating the underlying psychological factors of anorexia nervosa forms a consistent and unified basis for the claim.
