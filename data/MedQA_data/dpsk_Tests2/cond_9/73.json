Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core supporting the claim that hysteroscopy is the most appropriate next step in management. They collectively emphasize the need for further diagnostic evaluation after inconclusive initial tests (transvaginal ultrasonography, negative swabs), the potential to diagnose conditions like endometriosis or structural abnormalities, and the procedure's diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. The justifications consistently align with the claim's assertion that hysteroscopy is the next logical step given the patient's symptoms and prior findings.
