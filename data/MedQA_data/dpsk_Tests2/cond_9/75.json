Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim that surgical pinning is the most appropriate treatment. The justifications collectively emphasize the necessity of surgical intervention due to the femoral head displacement, the risks of non-surgical management, the benefits of stabilization and early mobilization, and the absence of contraindications. This shared basis uniformly supports the claim.
