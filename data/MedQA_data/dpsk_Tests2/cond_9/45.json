Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two P-type arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification points to pancreatic fluid leakage due to the patient's history of acute pancreatitis, while the second justification suggests decompensated liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C infection. These are distinct and unrelated explanations for the patient's symptoms.
