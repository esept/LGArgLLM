Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments justify the claim by linking the clinical scenario of anaphylaxis to the administration of epinephrine, which is known to increase Ca2+ influx in cardiac pacemaker cells. The first argument directly states this mechanism, while the second argument supports the use of epinephrine based on the clinical presentation. Thus, there is a shared semantic core supporting the claim.
