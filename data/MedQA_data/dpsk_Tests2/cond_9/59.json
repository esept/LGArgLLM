Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim of defective T cell function. The justifications consistently highlight clinical manifestations (persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, recurrent respiratory infections, failure to thrive) and diagnostic considerations (HIV PCR negativity, focus on primary immunodeficiencies) that collectively point to impaired T-cell immunity as the most likely cause.
