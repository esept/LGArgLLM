Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the need for echocardiography to evaluate potential cardiac issues (e.g., carotid artery stenosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, structural heart disease, cardiac emboli, or general cardiac stability) given the patient's symptoms, history, and upcoming surgery. Each justification supports the claim by highlighting different aspects of the patient's condition that warrant echocardiography.
