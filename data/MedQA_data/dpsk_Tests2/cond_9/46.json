Result: true  
Justification: All provided arguments share a common semantic core that TNF-alpha, secreted by Th1 cells, is responsible for the described actions (stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion, activating macrophages to produce NO, and contributing to tubercle formation). Each justification supports this core by referencing specific roles or mechanisms of TNF-alpha, ensuring a consistent and unified support for the claim.
