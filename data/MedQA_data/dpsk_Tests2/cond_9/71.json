Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that calcium ion efflux is necessary for myocyte relaxation, either by terminating the contraction cycle, lowering cytoplasmic calcium concentration, or through specific mechanisms like the sarcoplasmic reticulum pumping calcium back or the action of the sodium-calcium exchanger and plasma membrane calcium ATPase. This consistent focus on calcium ion efflux as the direct and necessary component for relaxation supports the claim.
