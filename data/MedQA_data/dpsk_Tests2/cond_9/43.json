Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core related to the color variegation (brown-black and red-white areas) in melanocytic lesions, supported by dermatopathology findings of neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. Each justification reinforces the likelihood of observing such color variations in the lesion, either through clinical hallmarks, pigment production, or correlation with pathology findings.
