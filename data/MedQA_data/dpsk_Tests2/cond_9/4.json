Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core: the patient's symptoms and ECG findings indicate tricyclic antidepressant toxicity (specifically sodium channel blockade), and sodium bicarbonate is the standard and effective treatment for this condition. Each justification supports this core idea, either by describing the patient's condition or the mechanism/effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate.
