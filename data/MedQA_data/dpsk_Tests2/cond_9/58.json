Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim of a vaginal septum. While they all argue against other potential causes of primary amenorrhea (e.g., endocrine disorders, excessive exercise, low body weight), none of them provide direct evidence or reasoning specific to a vaginal septum. The arguments collectively eliminate alternative diagnoses but do not converge on a shared semantic basis for the claim itself.
