Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the patient's likely aortic valve pathology or aortic dissection, which would produce a systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space. Each justification points to different aspects of the patient's history or presentation (heart murmur history, Marfan-like features, pain description, hemodynamic instability, absence of infection, and murmur location) that collectively support this conclusion.
