Result: true  
Justification: All justifications of the P-type arguments consistently support the claim by referencing developmental milestones that are typical for 1-month-old, 4-month-old, and 9-month-old infants. Each argument's justification aligns with the expected developmental progress for the respective ages, forming a shared semantic core that supports the claim about the patients' ages.
