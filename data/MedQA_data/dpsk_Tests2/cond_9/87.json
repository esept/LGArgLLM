Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that the right coronary artery is the primary blood supply to the posterior ventricular septum, and its occlusion is the most likely cause of the described transmural myocardial infarction. The justifications consistently support this anatomical and clinical correlation, making their combined support for the claim coherent and unified.
