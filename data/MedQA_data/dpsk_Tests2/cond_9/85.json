Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently emphasize the need for a CT angiogram due to the patient's symptoms (TIA suspicion), high-risk factors (atrial fibrillation, elevated blood pressure, multiple comorbidities), and the limitations of a normal head CT in ruling out vascular pathology. This collective reasoning forms a unified basis for the claim that a CT angiogram is the best next step in management.
