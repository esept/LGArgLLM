Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently highlight the classic symptoms and physical examination findings of osteoarthritis, the absence of red flags, and the typical presentation of degenerative joint disease that does not require further work-up. This shared basis confirms that no additional diagnostic testing is needed for this patient's condition.
