Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core supporting the claim that reassurance and pain management are the best next steps. They emphasize the minor nature of the injury (soft tissue injury, minor trauma), the appropriateness of conservative management, and the absence of contraindications for such an approach. This consistent focus on minor injury and conservative treatment forms a shared basis for the claim.
