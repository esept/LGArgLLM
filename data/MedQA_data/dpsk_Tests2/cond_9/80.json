Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that links the patient's lack of responsiveness to HAART therapy to gag gene mutations. Each justification either directly states or implies that gag gene mutations can cause drug resistance, leading to treatment failure, which is consistent with the patient's elevated viral load and low CD4 count. This shared basis supports the claim.
