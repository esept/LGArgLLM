Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications provided for the P-type arguments consistently point to Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) as the underlying condition that explains the observed features (microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, VSD, and IUGR). A prominent occiput is a characteristic feature of Trisomy 18, which is the common semantic core supporting the claim across all justifications.
