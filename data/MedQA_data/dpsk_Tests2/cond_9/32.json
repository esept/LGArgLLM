Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim about chlorhexidine's mechanism of action being best described by its pH-dependent activity and reduced efficacy in the presence of organic matter. While some arguments mention pH-dependence and organic matter, others focus on different aspects like broad-spectrum activity, substantivity, or the benefits of combining chlorhexidine with alcohol. There is no single intersection that all justifications support.
