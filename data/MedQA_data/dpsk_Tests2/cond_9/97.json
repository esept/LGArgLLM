Result: true  
Justification: All justifications consistently support the claim by pointing to urethral hypermobility as the primary cause of the patient's stress urinary incontinence. They highlight the patient's symptoms, clinical findings (Valsalva maneuver), history (vaginal delivery and cesarean section), and the absence of other causes (normal urinalysis, no dysuria/hematuria). The shared semantic core is the alignment of clinical evidence with urethral hypermobility as the most likely diagnosis.
