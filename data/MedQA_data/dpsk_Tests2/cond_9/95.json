Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations as the cause of the patient's symptoms. Each justification supports this core by linking specific clinical findings (e.g., prior meningitis, morning headaches, MRI findings) to impaired CSF flow, collectively reinforcing the claim.
