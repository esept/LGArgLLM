Result: true  
Justification: All the provided arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim that the patient's findings are best explained by plague. Each argument highlights different aspects of the patient's symptoms, history, and clinical findings that are consistent with plague, particularly pneumonic and bubonic forms. The justifications collectively emphasize the alignment of the patient's presentation with known features of plague, the endemic region exposure, and the absence of alternative explanations. This shared focus on plague as the unifying diagnosis forms a semantic intersection across all arguments.
