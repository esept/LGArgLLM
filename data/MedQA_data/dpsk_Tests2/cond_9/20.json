Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They collectively argue that sodium hypochlorite is effective against picornaviruses due to its broad-spectrum virucidal properties, supported by studies and regulatory recommendations, and its efficacy is not affected by the virus's hepatotropic nature. There is no contradiction or divergence in the justifications' support for the claim.
