Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the need for immediate surgical intervention to control postpartum hemorrhage and address the patient's hemodynamic instability. Each justification supports the claim by highlighting different aspects of the situation that necessitate uterine artery ligation, such as failed conservative measures, retained placental fragments, uterine atony, uterine inversion, and the patient's reproductive age. The collective justifications consistently point to uterine artery ligation as the best next step in management.
