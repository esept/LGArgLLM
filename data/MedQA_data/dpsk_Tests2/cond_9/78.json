Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. While they all relate to the diagnosis of a medial collateral ligament sprain, they address different aspects (localization of pain, absence of severe injury indicators, and lack of trauma). There is no single overlapping semantic basis that all justifications collectively support.
