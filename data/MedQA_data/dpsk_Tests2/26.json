  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 14-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and is found on ultrasound to have a gallstone. Based on clinical suspicion, a CBC, a Coombs test, and a bilirubin panel are obtained to determine the etiology of the gallstone. These tests reveal a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis as well as an increased RDW. In addition there is an indirect hyperbilirubinemia and the Coombs test results are negative. To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: In this patient, hypersegmented neutrophils would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained.",
