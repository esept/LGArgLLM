The patient\u2019s mother says that the patient was recently in northern Maine and spent most of her time during the trip outdoors. Physical examination reveals a slight asymmetry of the facial muscles with an inability to whistle or close the right eye. A circular red rash with central clearing is present on the trunk. There is also decreased taste sensation.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Ixodes scapularis is the most likely transmitter of the organism responsible for this patient\"s illness.",
