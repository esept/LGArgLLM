As a member of a research team working on the Hib vaccine, he asks his senior colleague why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The answer is that conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.",
