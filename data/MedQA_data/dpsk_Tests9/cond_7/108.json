Result: false
Justification: All the arguments provided share a common semantic subset related to the diagnosis of uterine fibroids as the cause of the patient's symptoms and the physical exam finding of a globular 10-week sized uterus. Each justification supports the claim by linking different symptoms or risk factors to uterine fibroids, which in turn explain the likely presence of a globular uterus. Therefore, none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
