Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content. For example, multiple arguments mention the hereditary pattern and conditions like familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), which are autosomal dominant. This shared focus on hereditary conditions and their inheritance patterns means the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
