Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, the first and fourth arguments both discuss how portal vein thrombosis can lead to complications like hepatic encephalopathy and ascites in cirrhotic patients. Similarly, the second and fourth arguments both mention portal hypertension and its association with portal vein thrombosis. Since there are overlapping semantic subsets contributing to the support of the claim, the justifications are not disjoint.
