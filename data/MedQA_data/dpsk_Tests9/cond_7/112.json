Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the claim. They both address the unlikelihood of the patient developing megaloblastic anemia due to the medication regimen, with one focusing on the lack of association between the medications and megaloblastic anemia, and the other on the patient's symptoms being more consistent with HIV-related complications. Thus, their justifications are not disjoint.
