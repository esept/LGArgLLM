Given the arguments provided, let's analyze whether at least one pair of their justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

1. **Argument 1**: Sudden onset of severe leg pain, pallor, and coolness is highly suggestive of acute arterial occlusion (commonly caused by arterial thrombosis).
2. **Argument 2**: Irregular pulse (likely atrial fibrillation) increases the risk of thromboembolism, supporting arterial thrombosis.
3. **Argument 3**: Asymmetry in popliteal pulses indicates vascular compromise, a hallmark of arterial thrombosis.
4. **Argument 4**: Hypertension is a risk factor for arterial thrombosis, and the patient's long-standing hypertension supports this.
5. **Argument 5**: Absence of other risk factors (smoking/alcohol) makes alternative diagnoses less likely, pointing toward arterial thrombosis.

- **Argument 1 and Argument 2**: Disjoint. Argument 1 focuses on symptoms (pain, pallor, coolness), while Argument 2 focuses on the irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation) as a risk factor. These justifications do not overlap semantically in supporting the claim.
- Other pairs (e.g., Argument 3 and Argument 4) may overlap (e.g., both relate to clinical signs/risk factors), but since at least one pair (Argument 1 and Argument 2) is disjoint, the condition is satisfied.

```
Result: true
Justification: The justifications for Argument 1 (symptoms) and Argument 2 (irregular pulse as a risk factor) are semantically disjoint in supporting the claim, as they address different aspects of the diagnosis without overlapping meaning.
