Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are related to the risks posed by elevated phenylalanine levels during pregnancy, particularly in the context of PKU. They all discuss the potential harm to the fetus due to high phenylalanine levels, such as congenital abnormalities, intellectual disability, and maternal PKU syndrome. Since all justifications overlap in their semantic content regarding the risks of high phenylalanine levels, none of them are disjoint with respect to the claim.
