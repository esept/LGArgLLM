Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to different aspects of the same diagnosis (plague) and overlap in their support for the claim. For example, the first argument mentions the geographic exposure and classic signs of bubonic plague, while the second argument discusses the respiratory symptoms consistent with pneumonic plague. These justifications are not disjoint as they all contribute to the same conclusion that the findings are best explained by plague.
