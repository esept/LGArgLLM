Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first two arguments focus on the patient's symptoms and history suggesting coronary artery disease as a reason for angiography, while the third argument suggests that the symptoms are more indicative of heart failure and recommends different initial management. The fourth argument emphasizes the patient's high-risk profile as a reason for angiography. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
