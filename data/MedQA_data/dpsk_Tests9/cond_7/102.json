Result: false
Justification: All the arguments' justifications are related to the benefits of sacubitril/valsartan for the patient's condition (HFpEF) based on clinical trials, guidelines, and the patient's specific symptoms and findings. They share common semantic subsets supporting the claim, such as references to HFpEF, clinical trials (PARAGON-HF), and the patient's clinical features. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
