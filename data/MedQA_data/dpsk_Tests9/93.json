In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely cause of this patient\"s symptoms is a 22q11 deletion.",
