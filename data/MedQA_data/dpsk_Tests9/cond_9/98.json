Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core, which is the definition of the psychological defense mechanism of projection. Each justification describes the man attributing his own unacceptable thoughts or behaviors (flirting with co-workers) to his wife, which is the essence of projection. The arguments consistently align with this definition, providing a unified support for the claim.
