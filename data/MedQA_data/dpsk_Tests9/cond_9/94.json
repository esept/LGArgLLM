Justification: All justifications collectively describe a coherent and sequential lymphatic route for metastasis from the ovarian primary tumor to the brain. Each argument's justification supports a specific step in this pathway, and together they form a shared semantic core that fully explains the claim. The justifications do not contradict each other and are all necessary to complete the logical sequence of the metastatic pathway.
