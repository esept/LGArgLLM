Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification points to clinical findings (stress incontinence symptoms, history of childbirth, Valsalva-induced leakage, absence of other symptoms, and compensatory behaviors) that collectively indicate urethral hypermobility as the most likely cause. The arguments consistently rule out other conditions and highlight the specific signs and history that align with urethral hypermobility.
