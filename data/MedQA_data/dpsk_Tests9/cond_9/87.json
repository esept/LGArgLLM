Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification relates the occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) to the anatomical and clinical evidence provided (posterior 1/3 ventricular septum infarction, right-dominant circulation, and typical RCA supply to the posterior descending artery). The justifications collectively reinforce the same conclusion based on consistent anatomical and clinical reasoning.
