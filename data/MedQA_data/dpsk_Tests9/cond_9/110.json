Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently highlight the impaired function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA1) due to ATP2A1 mutations, leading to prolonged elevated cytosolic calcium levels and delayed muscle relaxation. This shared basis aligns with the claim's assertion about increased muscle relaxation time and cytosolic calcium concentration in individuals with ATP2A1 mutations.
