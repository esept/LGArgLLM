Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments (e.g., first, second, and fourth) support angiography based on the patient's history of heart attack, symptoms of dyspnea, and high-risk profile, the third argument contradicts this by suggesting that the symptoms are more indicative of heart failure and recommends echocardiography and BNP testing instead of immediate angiography. This lack of agreement means there is no shared semantic intersection across all justifications.
