Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments (e.g., classic symptoms of osteoarthritis, absence of red flags) support the claim that no further work-up is needed, others (e.g., baseline X-ray, laboratory tests) suggest that further diagnostic tests might be warranted. These conflicting justifications indicate there is no shared semantic basis for the claim across all arguments.
