Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the adverse effect of anesthetic as the likely cause, while the second argument suggests transfusion-associated viral hepatitis or other viral causes as more plausible explanations. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
