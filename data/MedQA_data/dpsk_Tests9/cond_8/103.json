Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided have justifications that do not all share a common idea or reasoning pattern in relation to the claim. Specifically, the third argument suggests that initial management should focus on echocardiography and BNP testing rather than immediate angiography, which contradicts the other arguments that support angiography as the next step. This lack of overlap in semantic justifications means not all pairs of arguments share a common idea supporting the claim.
