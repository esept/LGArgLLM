Result: true
Justification: All justifications for the arguments share a common semantic theme related to the lymphatic and systemic circulation pathways by which ovarian cancer cells could metastasize to the brain. Each justification builds upon the previous one, describing a sequential step in the route (sentinel node → right lumbar trunk → cisterna chyli → thoracic duct → left subclavian vein → systemic circulation → brain). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their reasoning about the metastatic pathway.
