Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to clinical features (e.g., sudden onset of pain, pallor, coolness, irregular pulse, asymmetry in pulses) or risk factors (e.g., hypertension) that collectively support arterial thrombosis as the most common cause of the patient's condition. The justifications consistently reinforce the same underlying reasoning pattern linking these findings to arterial thrombosis.
