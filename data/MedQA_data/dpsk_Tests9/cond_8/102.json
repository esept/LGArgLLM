Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that sacubitril/valsartan is beneficial for the patient based on clinical evidence (e.g., PARAGON-HF trial), guideline recommendations, and the patient's specific symptoms and findings (HFpEF, hypertension, etc.). Each justification overlaps in supporting the claim through these shared medical and therapeutic rationales.
