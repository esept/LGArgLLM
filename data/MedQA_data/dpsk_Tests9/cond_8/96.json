Result: true
Justification: All arguments share a common theme of linking the patient's symptoms and history to plague. Each justification overlaps in discussing specific symptoms (e.g., inguinal swelling, fever, dyspnea) and their relation to plague, as well as the geographic exposure and absence of alternative explanations. The semantic intersections are clear across all pairs of arguments.
