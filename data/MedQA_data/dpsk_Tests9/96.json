  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe dyspnea and a productive cough containing streaks of blood since the day before. He had a sudden pruritic papular rash on his right thigh when he was in the southwestern USA hiking in northern Arizona and New Mexico. The next day he developed severely painful inguinal swelling on the same side; however, he did not see a physician and controlled the pain with painkillers. There is no other history of serious illness. He does not take any other medications. He appears confused. The temperature is 39.5\u2103 (103.1\u2109), the pulse is 105/min, the respiration rate is 32/min, and the blood pressure is 95/45 mm Hg. Rales are heard in the lower lobe of the left lung on auscultation. The right inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core. The surrounding area is edematous without overlying erythema or cellulitis. A computerized tomography (CT) scan is shown in the picture.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: These findings are best explained by plague.",
