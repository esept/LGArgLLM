On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain is through the sentinel node, right lumbar trunk, cisterna chyli, thoracic duct, left subclavian vein, and systemic circulation.",
