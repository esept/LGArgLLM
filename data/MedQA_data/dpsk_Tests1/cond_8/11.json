Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for dysthymia, specifically emphasizing the 2-year minimum duration requirement. The first argument directly states the 2-year threshold, while the second argument reinforces this by noting that the patient's 3-year symptom duration exceeds this minimum and aligns with classic dysthymia presentation.
