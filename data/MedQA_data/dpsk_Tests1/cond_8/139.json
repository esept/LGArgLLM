Result: true
Justification: Both arguments (A1 and A2) share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Both argue that the clinical presentation (green vomitus, abdominal distension, inspissated meconium plugs) is consistent with meconium ileus, which is strongly associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Both also link CF to infertility in males due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) or obstructive azoospermia. Thus, the justifications share common ideas and reasoning patterns supporting the claim.
