Result: true
Justification: Both arguments (justifications) are based on the CHADS2 scoring criteria for the same patient. The first justification cites the patient's age (73 years) as contributing 1 point, while the second justification cites her history of hypertension as contributing another 1 point. Both justifications are directly related to calculating the CHADS2 score for the same clinical scenario, thus sharing a common semantic basis in relation to the claim.
