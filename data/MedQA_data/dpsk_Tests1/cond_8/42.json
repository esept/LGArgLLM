Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea or reasoning pattern in relation to the claim. While some arguments focus on the need for an echocardiogram or right heart catheterization to assess pulmonary hypertension, others argue against the relevance of Holter monitoring due to the absence of arrhythmia or pulmonary embolism. These justifications do not overlap semantically in a way that supports the claim uniformly.
