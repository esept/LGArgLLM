Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim of asbestosis. The first argument focuses on occupational exposure, the second on the absence of infectious or malignant causes, and the third on the recurrent nature of symptoms. While all are relevant to the diagnosis, they do not overlap semantically in their justifications.
