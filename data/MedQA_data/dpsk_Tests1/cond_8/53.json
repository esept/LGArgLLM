Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that succinylcholine can lead to hyperkalemia in burn patients, which in turn increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The first argument directly states this, while the second argument elaborates on the mechanism (upregulation of acetylcholine receptors) that makes burn patients more susceptible to this effect. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
