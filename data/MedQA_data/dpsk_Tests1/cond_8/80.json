Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to specific symptoms or findings (e.g., fatigue, weakness, neuromuscular and cardiac symptoms, normal serum glucose) that collectively support the diagnosis of acid maltase deficiency (Pompe disease). The justifications consistently reinforce the link between the clinical presentation and the enzyme deficiency, ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
