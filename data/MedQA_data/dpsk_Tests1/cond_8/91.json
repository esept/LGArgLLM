Result: false
Justification: While all arguments oppose prescribing Chlorpheniramine due to its sedative effects, not all pairs share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about second-generation antihistamines being better suited does not directly overlap with the argument about the patient's explicit request for a non-sedating medication, as they focus on different aspects (alternative medications vs. patient's request). Therefore, not all pairs share a common idea or reasoning pattern.
