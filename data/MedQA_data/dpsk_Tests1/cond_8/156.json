Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase is important for maintaining glucose levels during fasting. The first argument states that the enzyme supports glucose homeostasis by providing an alternative energy source (ketone bodies), while the second argument emphasizes that its deficiency would lead to hypoglycemia, further underscoring its role in glucose maintenance during fasting. Thus, their justifications overlap in relation to the claim.
