Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that SSRIs (which inhibit serotonin reuptake) are effective for treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which aligns with the patient's symptoms of persistent worry and insomnia. The first argument explicitly states the mechanism of action (inhibiting serotonin reuptake), while the second argument supports this by explaining why SSRIs are effective for GAD (increasing serotonin availability and addressing the patient's symptoms). Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
