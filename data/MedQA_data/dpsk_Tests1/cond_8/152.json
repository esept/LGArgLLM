Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common semantic justification of prioritizing patient confidentiality and respecting the patient's autonomy. Each argument emphasizes the importance of not disclosing patient information without consent, whether it's due to ethical obligations, legal requirements (e.g., HIPAA), or the lack of legitimate need for the colleague to know the details. Thus, all justifications overlap in their core reasoning related to the claim.
