Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications. Each argument presents a distinct reason supporting the claim: the first focuses on acute liver failure, the second on the patient's travel to a high-prevalence region, and the third on the risk of preterm labor and maternal mortality. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern shared between all pairs of arguments.
