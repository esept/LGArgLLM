Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that heparin (or its derivatives) activates antithrombin 3, which is central to the claim. The first argument directly states this, the second contrasts it with other drugs but still affirms the role of antithrombin 3, and the third extends it to low molecular weight heparins. Thus, all justifications overlap semantically on the key point related to the claim.
