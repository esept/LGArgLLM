Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument connects the patient's symptoms (e.g., disorganized speech, flat affect, delusions, social withdrawal) to schizophrenia or psychotic disorders, which are associated with caudate nucleus atrophy. The justifications consistently reference the patient's behavioral and psychological symptoms as evidence for the likelihood of caudate nucleus atrophy on MRI, creating a common semantic link across all arguments.
