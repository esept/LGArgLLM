Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with an immune-mediated process involving antigen-antibody complex deposition. The first argument explicitly mentions immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis due to deposition of bacterial antigen-antibody complexes, while the second argument supports this by ruling out other primary renal pathologies and reinforcing the immune-mediated process. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
