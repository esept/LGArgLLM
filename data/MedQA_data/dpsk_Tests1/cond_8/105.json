Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument connects the patient's symptoms (fever, headache, myalgia, rash) and history (camping trip, tick exposure in Massachusetts) to Lyme disease, and justifies the use of ceftriaxone as the appropriate treatment for disseminated Lyme disease. The justifications consistently reference the same clinical and epidemiological reasoning.
