Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern that supports the claim (that the bleeding is in the duodenum). Instead, all arguments provide reasons why the bleeding is unlikely to be in the duodenum, focusing on different aspects such as the nature of the blood (bright red vs. melena), hemodynamic instability, absence of abdominal tenderness, cachectic appearance, and typical presentation of duodenal ulcers. Thus, there is no semantic overlap in the justifications that supports the claim.
