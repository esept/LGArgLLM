Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms (recurrent episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain with symptom-free intervals) are indicative of cyclic vomiting syndrome. The first argument explicitly states this, while the second argument supports it by mentioning the complications (malnutrition from recurrent vomiting) that align with the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
