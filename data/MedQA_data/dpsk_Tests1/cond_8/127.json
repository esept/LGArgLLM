Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that better hand-washing practices are effective in preventing the transmission of infectious agents in daycare settings, which is directly related to the claim about preventing the boy's condition. The first argument explicitly mentions the reduction of infectious agents causing diarrhea and conjunctivitis, while the second argument highlights the high-risk nature of daycare environments for such infections. Both justifications overlap in their focus on hand hygiene as a preventive measure in daycare settings.
