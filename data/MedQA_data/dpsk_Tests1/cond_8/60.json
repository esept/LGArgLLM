Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the patient's clinical presentation and history strongly suggest hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and that alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most relevant serum marker for HCC, not carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Each argument overlaps in reasoning that CEA is not specific to HCC, while AFP is, and this is tied to the patient's risk factors (cirrhosis, hepatitis C) and symptoms (weight loss, jaundice, hepatomegaly).
