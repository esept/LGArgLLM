Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the child's symptoms are severe and persistent, which could indicate status asthmaticus. The first argument focuses on the daily difficulty breathing and frequent nighttime awakenings, while the second argument highlights the reduced forced expiratory volume. Both justifications support the claim by pointing to severe asthma symptoms, thus overlapping semantically in relation to the claim.
