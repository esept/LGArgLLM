Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on the connection between congenital rubella infection and the observed neurological and developmental symptoms in the patient, as well as the MRI findings of periventricular leukomalacia. The justifications consistently highlight the role of congenital rubella infection as a critical risk factor for the patient's condition, with each argument reinforcing this idea through different aspects of the clinical presentation (e.g., hypertonia, developmental delays, feeding difficulties, and MRI findings). Thus, all pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
