Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the plausibility of the standard deviation due to rounding or measurement error in home blood pressure monitors, while the second argument speculates about the possibility of additional statistical adjustments or a larger dataset, which is not mentioned in the claim. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern between the two justifications in relation to the claim.
