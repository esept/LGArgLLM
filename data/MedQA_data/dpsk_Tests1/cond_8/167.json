Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss the physiological and neurological implications of the stroke (frontal lobe lesion and hypertensive emergency) leading to contralateral lower extremity weakness. The first and third arguments both reference the CT findings and their implications for the physical exam. The second and third arguments both mention the patient's vital signs in the context of stroke symptoms. Thus, all pairs overlap in supporting the claim.
