Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the patient's symptoms and findings (e.g., dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, peripheral edema, low voltage on ECG, ventricular wall thickening) strongly suggest cardiac amyloidosis or another infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and that a cardiac stress test is not the appropriate confirmatory test for this condition. Instead, they propose alternative diagnostic tests (e.g., biopsy, serum free light chain assay, cardiac MRI, technetium pyrophosphate scan, endomyocardial biopsy, protein electrophoresis, genetic testing) that are more relevant to amyloidosis or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Thus, all pairs of arguments overlap in their reasoning against the cardiac stress test and in favor of other confirmatory tests for amyloidosis.
