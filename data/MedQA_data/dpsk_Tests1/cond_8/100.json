Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications, as they all relate to the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) by addressing specific clinical features (e.g., positional triggers, short duration, absence of nausea, lack of lateralization, and exclusion of other pathologies). Each argument reinforces the others by overlapping in reasoning about the typical presentation and exclusion of alternative diagnoses for BPPV.
