Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The arguments consistently point to the patient's symptoms, recent medical history (mastectomy), and clinical findings (e.g., DVT, ABG results, tachycardia) as evidence supporting the suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) and the need for CT pulmonary angiography. Each argument reinforces the others by highlighting different aspects of the same underlying reasoning (e.g., risk factors, symptoms, and diagnostic clues for PE).
