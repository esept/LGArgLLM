```
Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms and family history suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and that verapamil is an appropriate treatment for managing the condition. The first argument explicitly mentions HCM and how verapamil helps, while the second argument also links the symptoms and family history to the need for treatment with verapamil to prevent lethal arrhythmias. Thus, their justifications overlap in supporting the claim.
