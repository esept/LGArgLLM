Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss the clinical presentation and the Gram-negative coccobacillus morphology. The first and third arguments both mention the exclusion of Neisseria meningitidis and the likelihood of Gram-negative coccobacilli. The second and third arguments both focus on the growth characteristics and the likelihood of Bordetella pertussis. Thus, all pairs overlap in their justifications supporting the claim.
