Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic justification related to the diagnosis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). The first argument mentions splenomegaly as a common finding in CML, while the second argument discusses fatigue and mild anemia as consistent with early stages of CML. Both justifications are directly related to the clinical presentation and laboratory findings supporting the diagnosis of CML, thus overlapping in their semantic content with respect to the claim.
