Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the presence of brown stones is indicative of an infectious etiology, specifically implicating E. coli as the likely pathogen. The first argument emphasizes the patient's symptoms and the finding of brown stones as suggestive of an infectious cause, while the second argument reinforces this by stating that brown pigment stones are rare in sterile bile, further supporting the role of infection. Thus, their justifications overlap in linking the gallstone coloring to an E. coli infection.
