Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the increased [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio due to ethanol metabolism disfavors the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, either by reducing oxaloacetate availability, promoting its conversion to malate, inhibiting pyruvate carboxylase, or shifting metabolic pathways. Each pair of arguments overlaps in their reasoning about the redox state's impact on gluconeogenesis and oxaloacetate utilization.
