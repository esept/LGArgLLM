Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the role of 2,3-BPG in modulating hemoglobin's oxygen affinity and its impact on oxygen delivery to tissues, which directly supports the claim that decreasing serum 2,3-BPG concentration would reduce oxygen delivery to skeletal muscles. The justifications consistently highlight the mechanistic link between 2,3-BPG, hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, and tissue oxygen availability.
