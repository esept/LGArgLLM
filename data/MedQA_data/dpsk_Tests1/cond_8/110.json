Result: true
Justification: Both arguments (P-type) share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. They both focus on the patient's symptoms (fissures at the corners of her mouth, corneal vascularization, darkly erythematous tongue, fatigue, and blurry vision) and link these to riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency, which is a constituent of NAD+ and NADP+. The first argument explicitly mentions the classic signs of riboflavin deficiency, while the second argument connects the symptoms to the systemic effects of riboflavin deficiency due to its role in NAD+ and NADP+ production. Thus, both arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms are indicative of a riboflavin deficiency related to NAD+ and NADP+.
