Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. While many arguments focus on the clinical and imaging findings suggesting biliary obstruction (e.g., elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, dilated ducts, and palpable mass), some arguments (e.g., the one mentioning the absence of elevated transaminases) rely on different reasoning. Thus, not all pairs of arguments share a common justification in relation to the claim.
