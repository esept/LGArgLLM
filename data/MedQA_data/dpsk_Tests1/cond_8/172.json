Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms, lab results, and test findings are consistent with sarcoidosis, which is strongly associated with enlarged hilar lymph nodes on chest X-ray. Each argument reinforces this diagnosis through overlapping justifications such as elevated ACE levels, negative PPD test, restrictive lung disease, and extrapulmonary manifestations like uveitis and arthralgias. The semantic overlap is clear across all pairs of arguments.
