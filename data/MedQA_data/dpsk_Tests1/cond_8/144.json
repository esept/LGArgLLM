Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on the patient's thrombotic leg lesion and links it to Factor V Leiden mutation, either by mentioning the increased thrombosis risk, resistance to activated protein C, or the inherited cause of thrombophilia. These justifications consistently support the claim by connecting the genetic defect in Factor V to the patient's condition.
