Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim. Each argument discusses the mechanism of action of the medication in the context of treating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and explicitly contrasts it with the incorrect option of blocking the sodium/potassium ATPase pump. The overlapping ideas include the inappropriateness of blocking the sodium/potassium ATPase pump for SVT, the likely use of adenosine, and the physiological effects of the correct vs. incorrect mechanisms.
