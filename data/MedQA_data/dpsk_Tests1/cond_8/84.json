Result: true
Justification: Both arguments (A1 and A2) share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Both arguments cite the patient's symptoms (progressive weakness, numbness, and bilateral facial paralysis) as classic or typical of Lyme disease, which supports the claim that a positive Lyme ELISA test is the most likely finding. The progression of symptoms from lower legs upward is also mentioned in both arguments as indicative of Lyme disease. Thus, the justifications intersect in their reasoning and support for the claim.
