Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms are consistent with an allergic reaction, which is typically managed with antihistamines like diphenhydramine. The first argument focuses on the classic symptoms of allergic rhinitis, while the second argument highlights the relief with cold water and recurrence of symptoms, both of which support the use of diphenhydramine. Thus, their justifications overlap in supporting the claim.
