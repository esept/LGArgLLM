Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. The first and second arguments both discuss the ABG findings (base deficit and metabolic acidosis) in relation to cardiogenic shock. The first and third arguments both connect the ABG findings to the broader context of shock (cardiogenic vs. other types). The second and third arguments both reference the clinical signs (distended jugular veins, muffled heart sounds, equal breath sounds) that point to cardiogenic shock as the cause of the ABG findings. Thus, all pairs overlap in their reasoning about the claim.
