Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the patient's symptoms being classic for HIV infection, the second on the patient's risk factors (unprotected sexual relationships), and the third on the appropriateness of the HIV viral load test. All three arguments intersect in their support for the claim that the screening test detects HIV viral load, as they collectively highlight the clinical presentation, risk factors, and diagnostic relevance of HIV infection.
