Result: true
Justification: Both arguments (P-type) share the same semantic justification in relation to the claim. They both assert that the patient's symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS), for which methylprednisolone is a standard treatment, and that eosinopenia is a known effect of corticosteroid therapy. The overlap in reasoning and support for the claim is clear, as both arguments rely on the same clinical and pharmacological principles.
