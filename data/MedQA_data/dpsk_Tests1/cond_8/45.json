Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the drug recommended by the physician (isotretinoin) has a molecular structure resembling drugs used to treat Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), specifically all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or other retinoic acid derivatives. Each argument also mentions the teratogenicity of isotretinoin and its use for severe acne, reinforcing the structural and functional similarities to APL treatments.
