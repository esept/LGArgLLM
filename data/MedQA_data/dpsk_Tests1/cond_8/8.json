Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms are linked to thiamine deficiency, which impairs the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme due to its dependence on thiamine pyrophosphate. The first argument explicitly mentions this connection, while the second argument supports it by explaining how a white rice diet leads to thiamine deficiency, thereby affecting the enzyme's function.
