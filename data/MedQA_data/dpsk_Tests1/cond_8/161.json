Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. Each argument independently explains why the ductus deferens is not related to the described error in kidney development, but they do not overlap in their semantic justifications. For example, one argument focuses on the embryological origin of the ductus deferens, another on its role in the reproductive system, and another on the independence of its development from kidney structures. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications.
