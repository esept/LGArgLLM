Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that vasa previa is unrelated to oxytocin administration, while the second argument discusses the patient's mental health history and its potential impact on stress responses, which is unrelated to vasa previa. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern connecting their justifications to the claim about vasa previa.
