Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. The first argument focuses on the duration of symptoms aligning with subacute bacterial rhinosinusitis, the second argument rules out more severe conditions due to the absence of certain symptoms, and the third argument further supports the diagnosis by considering the patient's healthy status. While each argument emphasizes a different aspect, they all contribute to the conclusion that subacute bacterial rhinosinusitis is the most likely diagnosis, thus overlapping in their support for the claim.
