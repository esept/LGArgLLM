Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to maintaining professional boundaries and ensuring safety in the physician-patient relationship. The first and second arguments both emphasize the importance of structured interactions (closed-ended questions and chaperone use) to prevent inappropriate behavior. The first and third arguments both address the need to reinforce professional boundaries due to the patient's confession. The second and third arguments both highlight the necessity of safety and transparency in managing the situation. Thus, all pairs overlap in their justifications.
