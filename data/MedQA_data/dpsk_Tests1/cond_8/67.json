Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the active hepatitis C infection poses a risk of transmission to the newborn, which supports the recommendation to formula feed. The first argument directly mentions the risk of transmission through breastfeeding, the second emphasizes the risk of vertical transmission, and the third extends this reasoning to other potential undetected infections. Thus, all justifications overlap in their focus on preventing infection transmission to the newborn, supporting the claim.
