Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument ties the patient's symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia) and travel history to Kenya to schistosomiasis, which is transmitted by freshwater snails. The justifications consistently reference the same disease (schistosomiasis) and its vector (freshwater snails), ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
