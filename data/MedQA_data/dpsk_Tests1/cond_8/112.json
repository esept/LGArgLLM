Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that retrograde blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle is associated with the patient's condition. The first argument links it to aortic dissection disrupting the aortic valve integrity, while the second argument associates it with aortic regurgitation due to conditions like infective endocarditis or aortic root dilation. Both justifications support the claim by explaining the pathophysiologic changes leading to the patient's collapse.
