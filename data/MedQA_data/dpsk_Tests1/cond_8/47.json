Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic justification related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its potential overlap with other autoimmune conditions like Sjögren's syndrome, which could involve salivary gland destruction. The first argument explicitly mentions SLE and secondary Sjögren's syndrome, the second connects the family history of autoimmune conditions to SLE and Sjögren's syndrome, and the third discusses autoantibodies (anti-SSA/Ro) common to both conditions. Thus, all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
