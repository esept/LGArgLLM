Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument ties the patient's symptoms (e.g., syncope, atrial fibrillation, diastolic murmur) and history (e.g., immigration from India) to mitral stenosis, which is the underlying cause of increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The justifications consistently reference mitral stenosis and its hemodynamic consequences, creating a common thread across all arguments.
