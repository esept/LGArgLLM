Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that penicillin is inappropriate for treating spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in this patient, and they all emphasize the need for a more appropriate antibiotic like a third-generation cephalosporin. The overlapping ideas include the patient's clinical presentation, the inadequacy of penicillin's coverage, and the urgency of correct treatment. Each argument reinforces these points, ensuring semantic intersection across all pairs.
