Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to findings (e.g., elevated serum calcium, renal dysfunction, hypercalcemia, bony pain, anemia) that collectively support the diagnosis of multiple myeloma with immunoglobulin light chain involvement. The justifications consistently reference the patient's clinical and laboratory findings to reinforce the same underlying cause.
