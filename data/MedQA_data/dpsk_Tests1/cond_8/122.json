Result: true
Justification: Both arguments discuss the mechanism of action of non-selective beta-blockers (specifically ß1 and ß2 adrenergic receptor antagonists) in the context of managing variceal bleeding in a patient with cirrhosis. The first argument mentions the dual ß1/ß2 blockade reducing portal venous pressure and rebleeding risk, while the second argument elaborates on how ß2 blockade reduces collateral blood flow to varices and ß1 blockade reduces cardiac output, both contributing to lowering portal pressure. The shared semantic content is the dual blockade of ß1 and ß2 receptors and their combined effect on reducing portal pressure.
