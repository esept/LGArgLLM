Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the edema factor (EF) of Bacillus anthracis acts as a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase, increasing cAMP levels and leading to edema, which is distinct from the mechanism of catalase. Each argument reinforces this idea while providing additional context (e.g., clinical presentation, zoonotic transmission, or mechanistic distinctions), ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
