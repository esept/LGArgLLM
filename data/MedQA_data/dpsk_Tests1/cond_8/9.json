Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. The first and second arguments both address the patient's history of myocardial infarction and the benefits of atenolol in this context. The first and third arguments both mention the patient's elevated blood pressure and how atenolol can help manage it. The second and third arguments both discuss the patient's cardiac condition and how atenolol can improve outcomes. Thus, all pairs overlap in their reasoning related to the claim.
