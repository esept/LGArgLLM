Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references the patient's symptoms, geographic exposure, and clinical findings (e.g., eosinophilia, rash) that are consistent with Schistosoma mansoni infection. The justifications collectively support the claim by reinforcing the same diagnostic reasoning.
