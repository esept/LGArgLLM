Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications, as they all relate to the claim by pointing out features inconsistent with Hodgkin lymphoma and more consistent with neuroblastoma. Each argument highlights different clinical or diagnostic aspects (e.g., biomarkers, abdominal mass, age, neurological symptoms) that collectively argue against Hodgkin lymphoma and for neuroblastoma, ensuring overlap in their reasoning.
