Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why oral prednisone is not the appropriate treatment, such as suggesting a platelet function disorder, ruling out thrombocytopenia, pointing to a coagulation factor deficiency, indicating the lack of necessity for prednisone without autoimmune conditions, and emphasizing the need for diagnostic testing first. These justifications are not overlapping in their reasoning.
