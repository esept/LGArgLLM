Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the patient's medical history (recent penicillin therapy and predisposition to allergic reactions) supports the claim of an allergic drug reaction as the likely diagnosis. The first argument focuses on the timing of symptoms after penicillin therapy, while the second emphasizes the patient's predisposition to allergies due to recurrent tonsillitis and asthma. Both justifications relate to the patient's history and its potential to cause an allergic reaction, thus overlapping semantically in supporting the claim.
