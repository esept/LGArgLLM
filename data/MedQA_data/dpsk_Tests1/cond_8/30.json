Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the patient's vegetarian diet as a risk factor for vitamin B12 deficiency. The second argument discusses the normal serum ferritin level ruling out iron deficiency anemia. The third argument highlights the increased demand for vitamin B12 during pregnancy. While all arguments support the claim, their justifications do not overlap semantically.
