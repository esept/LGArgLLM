Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on the presence of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) positivity, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and generalized itching as key indicators of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), which would be confirmed by liver biopsy. The justifications consistently highlight these clinical and laboratory findings as the basis for recommending liver biopsy as the next step in management.
