Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common idea related to the physiological response to exercise, specifically the increase in CO2 production and its effects on blood gases. The first argument discusses the decrease in venous pH due to CO2 production, the second discusses the decrease in arterial pCO2 due to increased ventilation, and the third discusses the decrease in venous pCO2 due to increased respiratory rate and cardiac output. All three justifications are interconnected through the theme of CO2 dynamics during exercise, ensuring semantic overlap in their support of the claim.
