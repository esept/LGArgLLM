Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common semantic intersection. While the first three arguments discuss life-threatening complications of amobarbital withdrawal (seizures, autonomic instability, delirium/psychosis), the fourth argument explicitly states that internal bleeding is not a recognized complication. This creates a semantic disconnect, as the fourth argument contradicts the premise of the claim (which mentions internal bleeding as a possible complication) and does not overlap with the justifications of the other arguments.
