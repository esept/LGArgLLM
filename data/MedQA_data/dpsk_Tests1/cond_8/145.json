Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. Each argument points to clinical features (e.g., absence of mucosal involvement, tense lesions, bilateral distribution) that collectively rule out other conditions (e.g., pemphigus vulgaris, linear IgA bullous dermatosis) and support hemidesmosome antibodies as the cause. The overlapping reasoning is the exclusion of alternative diagnoses based on specific patient findings.
