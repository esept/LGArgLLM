Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. The justifications consistently revolve around the patient's high tumor burden, the aggressive nature of CODOX-M/IVAC chemotherapy, the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), and the role of rasburicase in mitigating hyperuricemia by converting uric acid to allantoin. Each argument supports the claim by emphasizing different aspects of this unified clinical scenario.
