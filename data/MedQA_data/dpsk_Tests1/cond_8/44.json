Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common semantic justification that neutrophil count should be monitored due to the risk of neutropenia caused by 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy, especially in elderly patients. Each argument emphasizes this point, albeit with slightly different supporting details (e.g., myelosuppression, infection risk, age, surgery). The core reasoning overlaps across all arguments.
