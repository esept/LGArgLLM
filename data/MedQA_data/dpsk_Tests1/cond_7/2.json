Given the arguments provided, let's analyze their justifications with respect to the claim.

Argument 1 (A1): 
- Justification: The patient's symptoms of insomnia, diminished appetite, weight loss, irritability, hopelessness, and decreased concentration are classic signs of major depressive disorder (MDD), which St. John's Wort has been shown to help alleviate in mild to moderate cases.

Argument 2 (A2):
- Justification: The patient's lack of suicidal ideation and relatively short duration of symptoms (6 weeks) make St. John's Wort a reasonable first-line option before considering stronger medications.

Analysis:
- A1 focuses on the symptoms aligning with MDD and St. John's Wort's efficacy for such cases.
- A2 focuses on the absence of severe symptoms (suicidal ideation) and short duration, making St. John's Wort a reasonable first-line option.

These justifications are semantically disjoint because:
1. A1 does not mention the absence of suicidal ideation or duration of symptoms.
2. A2 does not mention the specific symptoms or St. John's Wort's efficacy for MDD.
3. There is no overlap in the semantic content that contributes to supporting the claim.

Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share any common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. A1 focuses on symptom alignment and efficacy, while A2 focuses on absence of severe symptoms and duration. They are disjoint.
