Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments overlap in their focus on the patient's severe hypertension and untreated essential hypertension as risk factors for aortic aneurysm or dissection. Both justifications contribute to the support of the claim by highlighting the same underlying risk factors, making them semantically related rather than disjoint.
