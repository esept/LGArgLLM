Result: false
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to the side effects of inhaled corticosteroids (specifically beclomethasone) as the cause of the oral candidiasis. They all contribute to the support of the claim by linking the observed symptoms (oral plaque) to the likely prescription (beclomethasone). Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
