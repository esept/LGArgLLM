Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all focus on congenital rubella infection as the risk factor, linking it to periventricular leukomalacia, neurological symptoms, and developmental delays. Since all justifications overlap in their support for the claim by referencing the same condition and its effects, there are no semantically disjoint pairs.
