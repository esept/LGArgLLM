Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All arguments relate to the claim by providing different pieces of evidence (e.g., immigration history, syncope episodes, irregular pulse, diastolic murmur) that collectively support the underlying mechanism of increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure due to mitral stenosis. The justifications overlap in their contribution to the claim.
