Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the mechanism of action of angiogenesis inhibitors (e.g., impaired wound healing, reduced blood supply, mucosal breakdown) and their contribution to the patient's symptoms (e.g., orofacial fistula). Thus, they are not semantically disjoint.
