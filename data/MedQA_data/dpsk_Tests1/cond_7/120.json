Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to schizophrenia and its association with caudate nucleus atrophy. For example, the first justification mentions "classic signs of schizophrenia," the second mentions "prodromal schizophrenia," the third mentions "functional psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia)," and the fourth mentions "psychotic disorder." All justifications converge on the idea that the patient's symptoms and history are consistent with schizophrenia, which is linked to caudate nucleus atrophy. Thus, none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
