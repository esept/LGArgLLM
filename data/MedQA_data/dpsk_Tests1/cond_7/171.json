Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a different aspect of the neurological findings and their relation to the lesion location, and none of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim. For example, one argument discusses the abducens nerve (CN VI), another the oculomotor nerve (CN III), another cerebellar dysfunction, another corticospinal tract involvement, and another the nature of the stroke. None of these justifications intersect in a way that contributes to the same support for the claim.
