Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. All three arguments point to features (thrombocytosis, elevated serum calcium, uric acid levels, systemic symptoms) that collectively suggest a myeloproliferative disorder, which is strongly associated with JAK2 mutations. Thus, their justifications are not disjoint; they share common semantic subsets supporting the claim.
