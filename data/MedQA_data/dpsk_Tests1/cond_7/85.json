Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments relate to the claim by discussing different aspects of Hepatitis B infection in pregnancy, such as its high mortality rate, the increased likelihood of exposure due to travel, and the associated risks of preterm labor and maternal mortality. These justifications overlap in their support of the claim that Hepatitis B portends the worst prognosis for the patient.
