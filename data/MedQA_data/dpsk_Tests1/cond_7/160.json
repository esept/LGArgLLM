Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that asthma contraindicates Metalimus (A1 and A5), and others mention that hepatitis C or severe cirrhosis reduces Metalimus efficacy (A2, A3, A6). These justifications share common semantic subsets (e.g., contraindications or reduced efficacy of Metalimus) that contribute to supporting the claim. Thus, no pair of arguments is fully disjoint.
