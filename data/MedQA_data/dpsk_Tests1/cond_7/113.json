Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct piece of evidence supporting the claim about immunoglobulin light chains: elevated serum calcium and renal dysfunction (A1), absence of proteinuria/hematuria (A2), combination of hypercalcemia, renal failure, and bony pain (A3), and anemia of chronic disease (A4). While all support the claim, they do so through non-overlapping justifications.
