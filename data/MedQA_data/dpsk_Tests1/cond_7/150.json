Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the patient's construction work history and potential asbestos exposure, the second on the absence of symptoms suggesting infectious or malignant causes, and the third on the recurrent nature of the symptoms. Each justification addresses a different aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
