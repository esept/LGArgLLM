Result: false  
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. They all discuss the patient's recurrent infections, family history, and the need for specialized testing (flow cytometry for CD18+ cell deficiency) due to suspected inherited immunodeficiency. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to the same line of reasoning supporting the claim.
