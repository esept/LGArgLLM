Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., patient confidentiality, lack of legitimate need to know, encouraging patient autonomy, legal violations, ethical obligations) that does not overlap with the others in terms of supporting the claim. Thus, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
