Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both arguments relate the patient's symptoms (rash) to a potential allergic drug reaction due to penicillin therapy and the patient's history of allergic predisposition (recurrent tonsillitis and asthma). The overlap lies in the shared focus on the patient's allergic history and recent penicillin use as contributing factors to the rash.
