Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the symptoms and signs of hypertensive emergency, such as headache, blurry vision, nausea, and bilateral optic disc swelling. The first argument focuses on these symptoms and their relation to increased intracranial pressure, while the second argument adds the elevated blood pressure and fever as contributing factors. Since their justifications overlap in supporting the claim, they are not semantically disjoint.
