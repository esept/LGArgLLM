Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to Lyme disease, its symptoms, and the appropriateness of ceftriaxone for treatment. Specifically, they all mention the patient's symptoms (fever, headache, myalgia, rash), the connection to Lyme disease, and the need for ceftriaxone as treatment. Therefore, no pair of arguments is disjoint with respect to the claim.
