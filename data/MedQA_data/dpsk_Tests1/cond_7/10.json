Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the inhibitory effect of somatostatin (or its analogue octreotide) on growth hormone secretion. The justifications overlap in their explanation of how somatostatin or octreotide decreases growth hormone production, either directly or through clinical context. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
