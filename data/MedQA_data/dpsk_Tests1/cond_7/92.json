Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument focuses on a distinct aspect of the patient's presentation (e.g., joint hypermobility, lens subluxation, tall stature and low BMI, absence of trauma) without overlapping in their supporting reasons. Thus, there is no common semantic subset shared between any pair of justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
