Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their focus on the patient's excessive worry, disproportionate symptoms, and repeated medical visits despite normal evaluations. All justifications contribute to the support of the claim (Illness anxiety disorder) by highlighting different aspects of the same underlying concern. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
