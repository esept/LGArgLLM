Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications refer to components of the CHADS2 score (age and hypertension) that contribute to the same claim (calculating the CHADS2 score). Since they share a common semantic context (contributing to the CHADS2 score), they are not disjoint.
