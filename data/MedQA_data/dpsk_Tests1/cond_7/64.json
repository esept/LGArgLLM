Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the clinical picture being classic for infective endocarditis and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, while the second argument emphasizes the absence of abnormalities on CT scan to rule out primary renal pathology. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
