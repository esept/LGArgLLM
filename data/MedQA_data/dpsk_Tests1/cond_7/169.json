Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why flecainide is not the correct drug (e.g., mechanism of action, contraindications, typical use cases, and QT prolongation effects), and these reasons do not overlap in meaning. Each justification stands independently to support the claim that flecainide is not the prescribed drug.
