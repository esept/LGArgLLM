Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the diagnosis of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: (1) acute myocardial infarction as a precipitant, (2) rapid heart rate and hemodynamic instability as classic features, (3) ECG pattern suggesting ventricular tachycardia, and (4) ongoing ischemia due to refusal of intervention. There is no overlap in the semantic content of these justifications.
