Justification: The justifications of the arguments all focus on different aspects of why chlorpheniramine is not suitable for the patient, such as its sedative effects, the patient's explicit request for a non-sedating medication, the availability of better alternatives, the risk to the patient's occupation, and the patient's prior experience with drowsiness. While they all support the same conclusion, their justifications do not share a common semantic subset; each provides a distinct reason.
