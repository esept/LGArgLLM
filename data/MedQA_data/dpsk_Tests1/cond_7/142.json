Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification focuses on the patient's symptoms being consistent with hypercalcemia caused by malignancy (adenocarcinoma), while the second justification highlights the patient's smoking history as a risk factor for lung adenocarcinoma. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
