Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the patient's symptoms as red flags for malignancy, the second on the absence of smoking history not ruling out lung cancer, and the third on the patient's age being within the typical range for lung cancer. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
