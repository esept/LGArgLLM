Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both arguments discuss the role of Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase in maintaining glucose levels during fasting, with the first focusing on its role in ketone body synthesis and the second on the consequences of its deficiency. These justifications share a common semantic subset related to the enzyme's function in glucose homeostasis during fasting.
