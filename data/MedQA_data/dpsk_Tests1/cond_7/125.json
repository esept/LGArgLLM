Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the infant's breastfeeding status and lack of concerning symptoms as reasons supporting breast milk jaundice. Additionally, the timing of jaundice appearance and the benign nature of the condition are recurring themes across justifications. Therefore, the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
