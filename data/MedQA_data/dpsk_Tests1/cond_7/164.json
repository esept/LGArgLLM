Result: false
Justification: All justifications for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to schistosomiasis and its transmission via freshwater snails. Each justification reinforces the idea that the patient's symptoms, travel history, and lab findings point to schistosomiasis, with freshwater snails as the vector. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
