Justification: The justifications of the arguments all focus on the mechanism of fenoldopam increasing intracellular cAMP production in renal vascular smooth muscle, but they do so from different angles (e.g., activation of adenylate cyclase, vasodilatory effects, specificity compared to other drugs). While they all support the same claim, their justifications are semantically distinct and do not overlap in meaning.
