Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share the same semantic subset in their justifications, which is the patient's symptoms (syncope during exertion) and family history (sudden cardiac death) suggesting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the need for treatment with verapamil. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
