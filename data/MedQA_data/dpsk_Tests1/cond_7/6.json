Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are about the historical attire of ninjas and their practical considerations for stealth, which are completely unrelated to the claim about the mechanism of temporal muscle atrophy in a patient with stage IV lung cancer. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
