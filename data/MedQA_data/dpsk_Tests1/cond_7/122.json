Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both arguments discuss the mechanism of action of non-selective beta-blockers (like propranolol) in reducing portal venous pressure through ß1 and ß2 adrenergic receptor antagonism, which is directly related to the claim. The first argument mentions the dual ß1/ß2 blockade reducing portal venous pressure and rebleeding risk, while the second argument elaborates on how ß2 blockade reduces collateral blood flow to varices and ß1 blockade reduces cardiac output, both contributing to lowering portal pressure. These justifications overlap in their semantic content regarding the mechanism of action of the medication in managing the patient's condition.
