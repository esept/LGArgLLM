Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their discussion of the mechanism of action of the medication (adenosine) and why blocking the sodium/potassium ATPase pump is not the correct mechanism. For example, multiple arguments mention that the medication works by slowing conduction through the AV node or interrupting the re-entrant circuit, and that blocking the sodium/potassium ATPase pump would have adverse effects. These shared semantic elements mean the justifications are not disjoint.
