Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all focus on the need to monitor neutrophil count due to the effects of 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy, particularly the risk of myelosuppression and neutropenia. While they each provide slightly different emphases (e.g., patient age, recent surgery), they all share the common semantic subset of monitoring neutrophil count due to chemotherapy risks. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
