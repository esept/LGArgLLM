Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Each argument provides distinct reasons (e.g., classic symptoms of Pompe disease, ruling out other metabolic disorders, specificity of neuromuscular and cardiac symptoms, absence of other enzyme deficiency symptoms) that are disjoint in their semantic content with respect to the claim.
