Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all revolve around the same core idea: the patient's symptoms, history, and findings point to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is not treated with beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonists. Each justification overlaps in supporting this conclusion, albeit with slightly different emphases (e.g., BMPR2 mutation, increased P2, liver function monitoring, nifedipine trial, lack of smoking/alcohol use). Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are entirely disjoint with respect to the claim.
