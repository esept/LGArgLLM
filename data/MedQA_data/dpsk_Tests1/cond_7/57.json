Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap in their support for the claim that levofloxacin is the most appropriate antibiotic. For example, the first and second arguments both reference the patient's symptoms and the sensitivity of the bacteria to levofloxacin. The third and fourth arguments also overlap in addressing the patient's risk factors and prior treatment failure, respectively. Since there is semantic overlap in the justifications, the arguments are not disjoint.
