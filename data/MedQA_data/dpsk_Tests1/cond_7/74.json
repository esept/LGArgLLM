Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument explains the mechanism of competitive inhibition and its effects on Km and Vmax, while the second argument contrasts this with non-competitive or uncompetitive inhibition, emphasizing the binding site difference. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to supporting the claim.
