Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. All arguments discuss the patient's symptoms (fatigue, shortness of breath, pallor) and link them to anemia, either due to Crohnâ€™s disease or methotrexate use. They consistently argue that PaO2 and SaO2 would be normal, while CaO2 would be reduced due to anemia. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
