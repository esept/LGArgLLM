Result: false
Justification: Both arguments (P-type) share a common semantic subset in their justifications: they both link the patient's symptoms and MRI findings to multiple sclerosis (MS), the use of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) as treatment, and the resulting eosinopenia as a side effect. There is no disjointness in their justifications with respect to the claim.
