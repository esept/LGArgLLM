Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the absence of certain symptoms (tenesmus, bloody diarrhea, fever) to rule out inflammatory or bacterial causes, while the second justification addresses the patient's vital signs (tachycardia, hypotension) as indicators of dehydration. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
