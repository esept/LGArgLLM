Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications relate to the beneficial effects of inhibiting Angiotensin II in the context of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, with one focusing on the mechanism (cardiac remodeling and fibrosis) and the other on the clinical context (hypertension and hypercholesterolemia as risk factors). Thus, they share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
