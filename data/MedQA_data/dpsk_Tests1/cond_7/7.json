Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the patient's response to treatment (fluid resuscitation and cooling) as evidence for sepsis. The first argument mentions the patient's fever, altered mental status, and tachycardia as signs of sepsis, while the second argument focuses on the rapid improvement in vital signs and mental status after treatment. Both justifications contribute to supporting the claim of sepsis by referencing the patient's clinical presentation and response to treatment, indicating they are not semantically disjoint.
