Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on managing hypertension, the second on improving survival post-myocardial infarction, and the third on alleviating exertional angina. Each addresses a distinct aspect of the patient's condition without overlapping in meaning.
