Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications relate to how hexamethonium could prevent the decrease in heart rate by blocking certain pathways (autonomic ganglia and muscarinic receptors, respectively). These pathways are interconnected in the context of heart rate regulation, so their justifications share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
