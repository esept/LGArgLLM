Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the severity of the child's asthma symptoms. The first argument focuses on the persistence and severity of symptoms (daily difficulty breathing and frequent nighttime awakenings), while the second argument highlights the reduced forced expiratory volume. Both contribute to the conclusion that the child's condition could be status asthmaticus, indicating overlap in their support for the claim.
