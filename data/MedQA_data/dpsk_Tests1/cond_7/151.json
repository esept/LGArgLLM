Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that albuterol is not the appropriate treatment for the patient's symptoms. Each argument provides different reasons (e.g., symptoms of panic attack, no respiratory distress, psychological etiology, ruled-out organic causes, appropriate alternative treatment) but all converge on the same conclusion. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
