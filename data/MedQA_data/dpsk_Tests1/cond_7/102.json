Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. All arguments mention mechanisms (ribavirin or DAAs) that decrease viral replication or inhibit viral RNA/protein synthesis, leading to reduced release of progeny virus. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
