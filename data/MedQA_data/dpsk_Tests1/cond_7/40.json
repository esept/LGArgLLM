Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments overlap semantically as they all point to the same clinical indicators (AMA positivity, elevated alkaline phosphatase, generalized itching) and the same diagnosis (primary biliary cholangitis) requiring a liver biopsy for confirmation. Thus, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
