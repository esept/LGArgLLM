Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments relate the patient's symptoms and family history to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its potential overlap with Sj√∂gren's syndrome, which involves salivary gland destruction. The semantic overlap is clear in their focus on SLE and autoimmune mechanisms, making them interconnected rather than disjoint.
