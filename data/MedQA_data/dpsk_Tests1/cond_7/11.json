Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset in their justifications, which is the 2-year minimum threshold for dysthymia. The first argument explicitly states the 2-year requirement, and the second argument also references the 2-year duration per diagnostic standards. Therefore, their justifications are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
