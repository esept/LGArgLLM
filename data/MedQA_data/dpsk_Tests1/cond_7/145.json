Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each focus on different clinical features (absence of mucosal involvement and Nikolsky's sign, characteristics of the lesions, and distribution of the rash) to indirectly support the claim about hemidesmosome antibodies. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
