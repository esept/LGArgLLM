Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to hyperinsulinemia as the probable cause of the newborn's condition, supported by the clinical findings and maternal history of gestational diabetes with poor glycemic control. The arguments overlap in their reasoning and evidence, reinforcing the same conclusion.
