Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a different potential complication of amobarbital withdrawal (seizures, autonomic instability, delirium/psychosis, and the incorrectness of internal bleeding as a complication). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications regarding the claim.
