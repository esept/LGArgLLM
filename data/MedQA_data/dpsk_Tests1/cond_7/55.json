Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the arguments about gastrin's role in gastric acid secretion and its lack of involvement in gallbladder contraction both address the same underlying point that gastrin is not the likely cause of the patient's symptoms due to its primary role in gastric acid regulation, not biliary function. This overlap in meaning means the justifications are not disjoint.
