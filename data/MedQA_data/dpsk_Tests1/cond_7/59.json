Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why the patient's symptoms do not align with Paranoid Personality Disorder, focusing on different aspects such as perfectionism (OCPD), repetitive behaviors (OCD), long-standing patterns, and lack of distrust. There is no overlap in the semantic subsets of their justifications that contribute to supporting the claim.
