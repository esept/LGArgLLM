Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a different aspect of the physiological response to exercise: the first focuses on venous pH, the second on arterial pCO2, and the third on venous pCO2. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
