Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why acid-fast cysts are unlikely in this patient, focusing on different aspects such as the typical pathogens involved (Entamoeba histolytica vs. Cryptosporidium or Cyclospora), the clinical presentation (liver abscesses and bloody diarrhea vs. pulmonary or disseminated disease), and the stool examination findings (neutrophils and blood vs. acid-fast organisms). There is no overlap in the semantic subsets of their justifications that contribute to supporting the claim.
