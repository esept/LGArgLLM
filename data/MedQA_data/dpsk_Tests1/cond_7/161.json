Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all emphasize that the ductus deferens is derived from a different embryological structure (mesonephric duct) than the renal structures (ureteric bud), and that it is part of the reproductive system, not the urinary system. While the arguments overlap in their general point, they do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim beyond this general distinction. Thus, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
