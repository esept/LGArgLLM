Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the need for incision and drainage: the patient's immunocompromised state, the standard of care for abscesses with cellulitis and systemic symptoms, the clinical presentation despite the absence of fluctuance, and the possible underlying condition of hidradenitis suppurativa. None of these justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
