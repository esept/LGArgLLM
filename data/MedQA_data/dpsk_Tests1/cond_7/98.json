Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, multiple arguments reference the patient's recent mastectomy as a risk factor for pulmonary embolism (PE), and others reference the symptoms (chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea) as indicative of PE. These justifications overlap in their support for the claim that CT pulmonary angiography is the most appropriate next step in management. Therefore, there is at least one pair of arguments whose justifications are not disjoint.
