Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are related to the claim and share a common semantic subset, which is the differential diagnosis between neuroblastoma and Hodgkin lymphoma in the given clinical scenario. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint; they all contribute to supporting the claim by highlighting why neuroblastoma is more likely than Hodgkin lymphoma based on clinical, biochemical, and demographic factors.
