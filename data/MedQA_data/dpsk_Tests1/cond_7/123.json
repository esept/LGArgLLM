Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides distinct reasons why thyrotoxic crisis is unlikely, focusing on different aspects such as pulmonary embolism, absence of thyroid-related symptoms, fat embolism syndrome, and typical presentation of thyrotoxic crisis. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
