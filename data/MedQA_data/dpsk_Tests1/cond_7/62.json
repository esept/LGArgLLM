Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the inappropriateness of penicillin for treating spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in this patient. They all emphasize the need for broader-spectrum antibiotics like cefotaxime due to the typical pathogens involved and the urgency of treatment. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
