Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification focuses on the patient's headaches being triggered by chocolates and verapamil's effectiveness for migraines, while the second justification addresses the absence of contraindications for verapamil based on the normal physical examination. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim.
