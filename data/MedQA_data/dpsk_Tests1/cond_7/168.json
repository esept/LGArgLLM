Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification discusses the structural placental abnormality (vasa previa) and its unrelatedness to oxytocin administration, while the second justification focuses on the patient's mental health history and its potential impact on stress responses during labor induction, which is unrelated to vasa previa. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
