Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their focus on the patient's dehydration, metabolic alkalosis, and the need for electrolyte assessment or fluid resuscitation, rather than measuring serum osmolal gap. For example, multiple arguments mention metabolic alkalosis and dehydration as key issues, indicating shared semantic content in their justifications.
