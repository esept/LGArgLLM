Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument links the patient's symptoms to aplastic anemia caused by parvovirus B19, which can also cause mononucleosis-like symptoms. The second argument suggests an infectious etiology like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the primary cause of mononucleosis. These justifications address different pathogens (parvovirus B19 vs. EBV) and different mechanisms (aplastic anemia vs. infectious etiology), with no overlap in their semantic content supporting the claim.
