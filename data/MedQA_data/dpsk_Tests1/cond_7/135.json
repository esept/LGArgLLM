Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments relate to the diagnosis of botulism, with overlapping themes such as exposure to environmental toxins or pathogens (A1), consumption of improperly cooked foods (A2), and the clinical presentation supporting a toxin-mediated etiology (A3). These justifications share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim, so they are not disjoint.
