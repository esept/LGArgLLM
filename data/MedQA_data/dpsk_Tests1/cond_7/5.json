Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the likelihood of an infiltrative bone marrow process as the etiology of the anemia. The first argument focuses on the low reticulocyte count suggesting a hypoproliferative bone marrow process, while the second argument emphasizes the absence of other common causes like hemorrhage or hemolysis. Both justifications contribute to supporting the claim by pointing towards an infiltrative bone marrow process, thus they are not semantically disjoint.
