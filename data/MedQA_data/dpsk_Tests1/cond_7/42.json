Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides distinct reasons why Holter monitoring is not the most logical diagnostic test, focusing on different aspects of the patient's condition (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, chronic pulmonary hypertension, absence of arrhythmia, progressive pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary vascular etiology). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
