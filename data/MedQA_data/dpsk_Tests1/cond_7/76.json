Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the effectiveness of prophylactic ciprofloxacin in preventing UTIs, particularly in the context of the patient's recent surgery and hospital-acquired infection risk. The first argument focuses on the general risk due to surgery and ICU stay, while the second argument narrows it down to the type of UTI (lower UTI), but both ultimately support the claim that ciprofloxacin could have prevented the complication. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
