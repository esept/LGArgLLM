Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification focuses on the plausibility of the standard deviation due to rounding or measurement error in home blood pressure monitors, while the second justification considers the possibility of the standard deviation being influenced by a larger dataset or statistical adjustments. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
