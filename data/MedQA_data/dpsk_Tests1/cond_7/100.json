Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). For example, the positional triggers (A1) and the absence of nausea (A2) both contribute to the diagnosis of BPPV. Similarly, the lack of lateralization (A3) and the absence of otoscopic abnormalities (A5) both rule out alternative diagnoses, reinforcing BPPV. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
