Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Each argument provides distinct reasons (normal BMI and lack of systemic symptoms, unrelated medical history and medications, physical exam findings and elevated FSH) pointing toward the need for karyotyping, but these reasons do not overlap semantically. Thus, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
