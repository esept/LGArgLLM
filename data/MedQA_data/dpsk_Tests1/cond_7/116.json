Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on thrombotic microangiopathies (TTP or HUS) as the cause of the symptoms, while the second justification points to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). These are distinct pathological mechanisms with different implications, even though both could explain the laboratory results. Thus, there is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications regarding the claim.
