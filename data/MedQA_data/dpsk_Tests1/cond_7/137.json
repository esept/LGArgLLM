Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. Both justifications emphasize the patient's asymptomatic status, normal clinical findings, and lack of abnormalities, which collectively support the claim that reassurance and follow-up are the most appropriate next steps. Since their justifications share a common semantic subset (the patient's stable and healthy condition), they are not disjoint.
