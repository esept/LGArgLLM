Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why dantrolene is unlikely to be the cause of prolonged muscle paralysis, focusing on different aspects such as its mechanism of action, typical uses, and comparison with other drugs. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
