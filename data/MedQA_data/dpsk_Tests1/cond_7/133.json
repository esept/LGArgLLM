Result: false
Justification: Both arguments (P-type) share a common semantic subset in their justifications, as they both focus on the patient's symptoms (fatigue, lack of motivation, hopelessness) and social stressors (dating struggles) as indicators of depression. This overlap in meaning means their justifications are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
