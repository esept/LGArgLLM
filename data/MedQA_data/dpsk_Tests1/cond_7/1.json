Given the input, we have two arguments (P1 and P2) supporting the claim that the most likely diagnosis is Cyclic vomiting syndrome. 

- P1's justification focuses on the classic symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome (recurrent episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain with symptom-free intervals).  
- P2's justification highlights the patient's emaciation and weight percentile as indicative of malnutrition due to recurrent vomiting, a known complication of cyclic vomiting syndrome.  

These justifications address different aspects of the diagnosis: P1 focuses on symptom presentation, while P2 focuses on a complication (malnutrition). They do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.  

Thus, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.  

```
Result: true  
Justification: The justifications of P1 and P2 address different aspects (symptoms vs. complications) of cyclic vomiting syndrome and do not overlap semantically in supporting the claim.
