Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why oral prednisone is not the appropriate treatment, such as suggesting a platelet function disorder, ruling out thrombocytopenia, indicating a coagulation factor deficiency, stating the lack of indication for prednisone without autoimmune condition, and emphasizing the need for diagnostic testing first. None of the justifications overlap in their reasoning or share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
