Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and third arguments both reference the patient's history of myocardial infarction and stent placement, as well as the presence of fever and elevated troponin I, to support the diagnosis of pericarditis. Similarly, the second and third arguments both mention the inflammatory process (fever and elevated troponin I) as indicative of pericarditis. Thus, there is overlap in the semantic content of the justifications with respect to the claim.
