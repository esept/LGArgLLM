Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification focuses on the risk factors for volvulus (chronic constipation and laxative use), while the second justification discusses the absence of signs of infection or inflammation. These justifications address different aspects of the diagnosis and do not overlap in meaning with respect to supporting the claim of volvulus.
