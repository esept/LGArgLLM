Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Both justifications emphasize the association between brown pigment stones and an infectious etiology, specifically implicating E. coli as the likely pathogen. The first justification highlights the patient's symptoms and the finding of brown stones as suggestive of an infectious cause, while the second justification notes the rarity of brown stones in sterile bile, further supporting the infectious etiology. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
