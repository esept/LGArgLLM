Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct pharmacological effect or observation related to the Î±1 adrenergic agonist (e.g., mydriasis, vasoconstriction, eyelid retraction, implausibility of relaxation), and none of them share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim about the relaxation of the pupillary dilator muscle with no effect on the ciliary muscle.
