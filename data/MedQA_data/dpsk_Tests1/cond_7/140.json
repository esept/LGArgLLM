Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why inadequate myenteric plexus innervation is unlikely, such as the symptoms being classic for pyloric stenosis, the presence of a firm non-tender mass, the unrelated history of respiratory infection, the typical presentation of Hirschsprung disease, and the secondary nature of lethargy and dehydration. None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
