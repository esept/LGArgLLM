Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the patient's symptoms (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools) and lab findings (elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) as evidence against acetaminophen-induced liver injury and in favor of biliary obstruction. Additionally, several arguments reference the imaging findings (dilated ducts and distended gallbladder) and the palpable mass as indicative of a mechanical obstruction rather than hepatocellular injury. These common themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
