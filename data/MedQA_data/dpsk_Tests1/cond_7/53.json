Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to succinylcholine causing hyperkalemia in burn patients, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. The first argument directly states this, while the second argument elaborates on the mechanism (upregulation of acetylcholine receptors) that makes burn patients more susceptible to this effect. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
