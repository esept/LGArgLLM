Result: false
Justification: Both arguments (P-type) share a common semantic subset related to the efficacy of SSRIs in treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and improving sleep by increasing serotonin availability. The justifications overlap in supporting the claim that inhibiting serotonin reuptake is the most effective mechanism of action for the patient's condition. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
