Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments relate to the claim by discussing the connection between the patient's symptoms, vegan diet, and vitamin B12 deficiency, which in turn affects the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. The justifications overlap in their focus on the role of vitamin B12 deficiency in the context of the patient's symptoms and diet.
