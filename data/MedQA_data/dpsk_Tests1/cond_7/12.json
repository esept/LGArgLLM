Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to maintaining professional boundaries and ensuring safety in the physician-patient relationship. The first justification focuses on the use of closed-ended questions to prevent inappropriate elaboration, the second on the role of a chaperone in ensuring transparency and safety, and the third on addressing transference through structured interactions. All three justifications contribute to the same overarching goal of managing the patient's inappropriate feelings and maintaining professionalism, thus they are not disjoint.
