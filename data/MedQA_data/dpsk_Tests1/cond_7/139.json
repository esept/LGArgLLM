Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset in their justifications, as they both link the clinical presentation (meconium ileus, microcolon, inspissated meconium plugs) to cystic fibrosis (CF) and subsequently to infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). The overlap in meaning means their justifications are not disjoint.
