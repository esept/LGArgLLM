Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why Vitamin K deficiency is not the likely cause of the patient's condition, focusing on different aspects of the clinical and laboratory findings (e.g., platelet aggregation, PT/PTT values, platelet morphology, and clinical presentation). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
