Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments share a common semantic subset related to the role of 2,3-BPG in hemoglobin's oxygen affinity and its effect on oxygen delivery to tissues. Specifically, all justifications discuss how decreasing 2,3-BPG increases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, thereby reducing oxygen delivery to skeletal muscles. Since none of the pairs of arguments have disjoint justifications with respect to the claim, the result is false.
