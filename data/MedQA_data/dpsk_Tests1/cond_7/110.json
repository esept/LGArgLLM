Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments both relate the patient's symptoms (fissures at the corners of her mouth, corneal vascularization, darkly erythematous tongue, fatigue, and blurry vision) to riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency, which is a constituent of NAD+ and NADP+. Both arguments share the same semantic subset linking the symptoms to the vitamin deficiency and its role in NAD+ and NADP+ production, so they are not disjoint.
