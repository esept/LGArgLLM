Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around the mechanism of action of Isoproterenol as a beta-adrenergic agonist, its use in asthma and COPD, and its similarity to other bronchodilators. They share a common semantic subset in discussing the drug's action on beta-2 receptors and its relevance to the patient's condition. Therefore, no pair of arguments is disjoint.
