Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the patient's leukopenia and neutropenia increasing the risk of bacterial infections, the second on the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in reducing infections in neutropenic patients, and the third on the irrelevance of the platelet count to the decision to use ciprofloxacin. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
