Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the structural resemblance of isotretinoin to retinoic acid derivatives (e.g., ATRA or tretinoin) used in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
