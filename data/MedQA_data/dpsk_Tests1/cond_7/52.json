Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing overlapping evidence against the myotonin protein kinase defect and pointing towards Duchenne muscular dystrophy. For example, the delayed walking onset, Gower sign, and absence of myotonia are all mentioned in multiple justifications, indicating shared semantic subsets.
