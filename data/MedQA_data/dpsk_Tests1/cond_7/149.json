Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why the bleeding is unlikely to be from the duodenum, such as the nature of the blood (bright red vs. melena), hemodynamic instability, absence of abdominal tenderness, cachectic appearance suggesting malignancy, and the typical presentation of duodenal ulcers. These justifications do not overlap in meaning but collectively support the claim by addressing different aspects of the clinical scenario.
