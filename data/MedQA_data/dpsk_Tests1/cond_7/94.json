Justification: The justifications of all arguments overlap semantically as they all refer to the clinical presentation, Gram stain findings, and specific requirements of Bordetella pertussis, which collectively support the use of Charcoal yeast with iron and cysteine medium. None of the argument pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
