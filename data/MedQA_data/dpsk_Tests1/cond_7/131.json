Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications relate to the claim by providing evidence supporting the diagnosis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). The first justification mentions splenomegaly as a common finding in CML, while the second justification points to fatigue and mild anemia as consistent with early stages of CML. Both contribute to the same overall support for the claim, indicating overlap in their semantic contribution to the diagnosis.
