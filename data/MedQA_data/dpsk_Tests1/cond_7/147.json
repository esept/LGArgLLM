Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each justification addresses a different aspect of the diagnosis: the duration of symptoms, the absence of severe symptoms, and the patient's healthy status. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to supporting the claim.
