Result: false
Justification: Both arguments (P-type) share a common semantic subset related to the characteristics of a cross-sectional study. The first justification emphasizes the single-point data collection, while the second focuses on prevalence and association rather than causation. Both contribute to supporting the claim that the study is cross-sectional, meaning their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
