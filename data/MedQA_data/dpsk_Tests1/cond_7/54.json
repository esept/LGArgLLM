Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. All three arguments link the auscultatory finding (wide, fixed splitting of S2) to an atrial septal defect (ASD), which in turn explains the mechanism of paradoxical embolism leading to the patient's symptoms. Since none of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false.
