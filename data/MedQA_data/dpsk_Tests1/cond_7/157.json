Result: false
Justification: Both arguments (P-type) share overlapping semantic content in their justifications, as they both link the patient's symptoms (oral ulcers, weight loss, diarrhea) to Crohn's disease and its association with ASCA positivity. Thus, their justifications are not disjoint with respect to the claim.
