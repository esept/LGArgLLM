Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides distinct reasons (e.g., symptoms consistent with sickle cell disease, absence of Kawasaki disease features, recurrent episodes suggesting chronic condition, prevalence in Ghana) that do not overlap in meaning but collectively support the claim. At least one pair of arguments (e.g., the first and second arguments) has justifications that are disjoint in their semantic contribution to the claim.
