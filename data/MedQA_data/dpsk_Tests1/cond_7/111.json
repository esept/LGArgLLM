Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the high tumor burden and rapid cell lysis leading to the need for rasburicase, indicating an overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. Similarly, the third and fifth arguments both address the physician's concern about complications and the necessity of rasburicase, showing another overlap. Therefore, there are no pairs of arguments whose justifications are completely disjoint in meaning with respect to the claim.
