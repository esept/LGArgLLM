Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All arguments share the common semantic subset that the patient's symptoms and findings suggest cardiac amyloidosis, and a cardiac stress test is not the appropriate confirmatory test. Instead, they propose alternative tests like biopsy, serum free light chain assay, cardiac MRI, technetium pyrophosphate scan, endomyocardial biopsy, or genetic testing. Thus, the justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
