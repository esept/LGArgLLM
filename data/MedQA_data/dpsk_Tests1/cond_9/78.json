Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim of "Acetaminophen-induced liver injury." Instead, they collectively argue against this claim, pointing to biliary obstruction or malignancy as more likely causes based on the patient's symptoms, lab findings, and imaging results. The arguments emphasize features inconsistent with acetaminophen-induced liver injury (e.g., obstructive jaundice, absence of elevated transaminases) and highlight findings suggestive of alternative diagnoses (e.g., dilated ducts, palpable mass). Thus, there is no shared semantic basis supporting the claim.
