Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments focus on different aspects of the patient's symptoms and their relation to allergic rhinitis and histamine-mediated reactions. While both justifications support the use of diphenhydramine, they do not share a common semantic core that intersects across all arguments. One justification emphasizes the classic symptoms of allergic rhinitis, while the other focuses on the relief and recurrence pattern with cold water. Therefore, there is no single shared semantic basis that unites all justifications.
