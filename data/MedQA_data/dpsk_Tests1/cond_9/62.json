Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that penicillin is the best treatment. Instead, they collectively argue against penicillin and advocate for alternative treatments like third-generation cephalosporins. The justifications focus on the inappropriateness of penicillin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to its poor coverage of typical pathogens and emphasize the need for broader-spectrum antibiotics. Thus, there is no shared semantic basis supporting the claim.
