Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim that the patient's symptoms and test results are indicative of sarcoidosis, which is strongly associated with enlarged hilar lymph nodes on chest X-ray. Each justification references sarcoidosis and its typical radiographic findings, creating a consistent and overlapping basis for the claim.
