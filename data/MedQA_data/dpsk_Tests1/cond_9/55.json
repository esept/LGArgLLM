Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that gastrin is the cause of the postprandial aggravation of symptoms. Instead, they collectively argue against gastrin and point to cholecystokinin (CCK) as the more likely hormone involved, given the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation. The arguments are consistent in their opposition to the claim, not in supporting it.
