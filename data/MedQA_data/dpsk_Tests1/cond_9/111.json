Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core related to the justification for using rasburicase in the context of Burkitt lymphoma and chemotherapy. The justifications consistently highlight the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), hyperuricemia, and the need to mitigate these complications by converting uric acid to allantoin, which is non-toxic and easily excreted. This shared focus on rasburicase's role in preventing TLS and its mechanism of action (converting uric acid to allantoin) supports the claim.
