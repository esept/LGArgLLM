Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against prescribing Chlorpheniramine due to its sedative effects, which contradicts the claim. The arguments focus on the unsuitability of Chlorpheniramine for the patient's needs, rather than supporting its prescription.
