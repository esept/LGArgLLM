Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that links the infant's symptoms (fatigue, weakness, difficulty feeding, decreased muscle tone, cardiomegaly) to Pompe disease, which is caused by a deficiency of acid maltase. Each justification reinforces this diagnosis by ruling out other conditions or emphasizing the specificity of the symptoms for Pompe disease.
