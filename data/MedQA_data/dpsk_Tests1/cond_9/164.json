Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that links the patient's symptoms (fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia) and travel history (Kenya) to schistosomiasis, which is transmitted by freshwater snails. The justifications consistently point to freshwater snails as the vector for the patient's condition, supporting the claim with overlapping evidence.
