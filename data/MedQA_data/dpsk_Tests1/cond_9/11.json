Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share the common semantic core that the patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for dysthymia, specifically emphasizing the 2-year minimum duration requirement. The first argument highlights that the symptoms have persisted for 3 years, exceeding the threshold, while the second argument confirms that the chronic but mild depressive symptoms align with the 2-year requirement for dysthymia. Both justifications support the claim by referencing the 2-year minimum duration, thus sharing a semantic intersection.
