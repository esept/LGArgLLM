Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The claim suggests relaxation of the pupillary dilator muscle, but all arguments contradict this by stating that Î±1 adrenergic agonists cause contraction (not relaxation) of the pupillary dilator muscle, leading to mydriasis. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim's assertion of relaxation.
