Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on compensatory upregulation of hepatic cholesterol synthesis, the second on the compounding risk from multiple medications, and the third on underlying NAFLD. While all relate to hepatotoxicity, they address different mechanisms or risk factors without a unifying semantic intersection.
