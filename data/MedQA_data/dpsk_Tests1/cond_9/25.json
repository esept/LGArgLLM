Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on chronic constipation and laxative use increasing the risk of volvulus, while the second justification argues against infectious or inflammatory causes based on the absence of fever and stable vital signs. These are distinct lines of reasoning and do not intersect semantically to support the claim in the same way.
