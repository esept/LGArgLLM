Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that CEA is the most strongly associated serum marker for this patient's condition. Instead, they collectively argue that AFP, not CEA, is the most relevant marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the likely diagnosis given the patient's history and symptoms. The arguments consistently refute the claim rather than supporting it.
