Result: true  
Justification: All the P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification points to clinical findings (e.g., symptoms, history, lab results) that collectively raise suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE) and justify the need for CT pulmonary angiography. The intersection of these justifications is the high probability of PE in this patient, given her symptoms, risk factors, and diagnostic findings.
