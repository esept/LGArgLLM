Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that the patient's symptoms and history (BMPR2 mutation, chronic dyspnea, increased P2) strongly suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is not treated with beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonists. The justifications consistently point to PAH as the underlying condition and rule out beta-2 agonists as the correct treatment, aligning with the claim's context.
