Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of both arguments support the idea that conductive hearing loss is associated with Waardenburg’s syndrome, either due to inner ear abnormalities or craniofacial anomalies. There is no semantic intersection that would suggest conductive hearing loss is not associated with the syndrome. Therefore, the combined justifications do not support the claim that conductive hearing loss is not associated with Waardenburg’s syndrome.
