Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument points to parvovirus B19 as the pathogen causing aplastic anemia and mononucleosis-like symptoms, while the second argument suggests Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as the cause of mononucleosis. These are different pathogens with different implications for the patient's condition. Therefore, there is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim uniformly.
