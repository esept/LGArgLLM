Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to mitral stenosis leading to increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Each justification points to different clinical findings (history of immigration, syncope, atrial fibrillation, diastolic murmur) that collectively support the claim by linking them to mitral stenosis and its hemodynamic consequences.
