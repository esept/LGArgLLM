Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim (Vitamin K deficiency) by pointing to different findings (prolonged bleeding time, normal PT/PTT, enlarged platelets, etc.) that are inconsistent with Vitamin K deficiency and suggest alternative diagnoses (von Willebrand disease, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, platelet function disorder). There is no intersection of justifications supporting the claim.
