Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim that incision and drainage is the most appropriate next step in management. The justifications collectively emphasize the patient's immunocompromised state, the clinical presentation of abscess with cellulitis and systemic symptoms, the need for immediate intervention, and the potential underlying condition (hidradenitis suppurativa) that often requires surgical management. These points consistently converge on the necessity of incision and drainage as the appropriate treatment.
