Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core supporting the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). They collectively emphasize the positional triggers, short duration of episodes, absence of nausea, lack of lateralization, and exclusion of other pathologies (e.g., central causes or middle ear issues). This consistent focus on features specific to BPPV forms a shared semantic basis for the claim.
