Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim of "Inadequate myenteric plexus innervation." Instead, they collectively argue against this diagnosis by pointing to symptoms and findings (e.g., forceful vomiting, epigastric mass) that are more consistent with pyloric stenosis and inconsistent with inadequate myenteric plexus innervation. There is no overlap in justifications that supports the claim.
