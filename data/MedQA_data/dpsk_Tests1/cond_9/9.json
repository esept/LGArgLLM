Result: true  
Justification: All three P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the use of atenolol for this patient. The justifications collectively highlight atenolol's benefits in managing hypertension (relevant to the patient's history), improving post-myocardial infarction outcomes, and alleviating exertional angina by reducing cardiac workload. These points intersect in advocating for atenolol as the best next step in management.
