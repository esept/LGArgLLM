Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first argument highlights that Angiotensin II promotes cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, and inhibiting it would slow disease progression in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The second argument emphasizes that the patient's conditions (hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) are risk factors for heart failure, and Angiotensin II inhibition is a cornerstone therapy in such cases. Both justifications converge on the idea that inhibiting Angiotensin II is beneficial for the patient's specific condition, thus supporting the same semantic basis for the claim.
