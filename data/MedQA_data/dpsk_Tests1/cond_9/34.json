Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently highlight the patient's symptoms (e.g., fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, eosinophilia, elevated IgE) and recent exposure to freshwater in endemic regions (Malawi and Mozambique) as key evidence pointing to Schistosoma mansoni infection. The arguments collectively reinforce the same diagnostic basis for the claim.
