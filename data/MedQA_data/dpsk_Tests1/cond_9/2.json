Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic basis that the patient's symptoms align with mild to moderate major depressive disorder (MDD), and St. John's Wort is a suitable treatment for this condition. The first argument highlights the classic signs of MDD, while the second emphasizes the patient's lack of severe symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation) and short duration, both supporting the use of St. John's Wort as a first-line treatment.
