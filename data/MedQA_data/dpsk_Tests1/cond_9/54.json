Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that links wide, fixed splitting of S2 to an atrial septal defect (ASD), which facilitates paradoxical embolism, thereby explaining the patient's stroke-like symptoms and right calf pain/swelling (DVT). Each argument reinforces this mechanism, making the collective support for the claim consistent and unified.
