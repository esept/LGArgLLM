Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that heparin activates antithrombin 3, which is the key characteristic mentioned in the claim. The first argument directly states this, the second contrasts it with other drugs that do not require antithrombin 3, and the third extends it to low molecular weight heparins. All justifications support the same semantic basis for the claim.
