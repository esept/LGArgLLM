Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently point to the patient's symptoms (fever, headache, myalgia, rash), the resemblance of the rash to erythema migrans, and the epidemiological context (camping trip in Massachusetts, tick exposure) as indicative of Lyme disease, which warrants treatment with ceftriaxone for disseminated cases. The overlap in these justifications provides a unified basis for the claim.
