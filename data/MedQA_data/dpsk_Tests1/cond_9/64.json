Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments' justifications support the claim by pointing to immune complex-mediated processes (infective endocarditis and immune-mediated glomerulonephritis) as the cause of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. The first argument explicitly mentions deposition of bacterial antigen-antibody complexes, while the second argument supports this by ruling out other pathologies and reinforcing the immune-mediated nature of the condition. Thus, there is a shared semantic core supporting the claim.
