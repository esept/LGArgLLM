Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that decreasing serum 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentration increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, thereby reducing oxygen delivery to tissues (skeletal muscles). Each argument supports this mechanism, either by mentioning the binding effect of 2,3-BPG on hemoglobin, the leftward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, or the impairment of physiological hypoxia adaptation. Thus, they collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
