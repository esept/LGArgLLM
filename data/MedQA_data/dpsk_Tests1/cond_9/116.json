Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument points to thrombotic microangiopathies (TTP or HUS) as the likely cause, while the second argument suggests disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Although both conditions involve similar lab findings (decreased platelets, schistocytes), their underlying pathophysiologies and implications are distinct, and neither justification fully overlaps with the other in supporting the claim. Therefore, there is no shared semantic intersection across all justifications.
