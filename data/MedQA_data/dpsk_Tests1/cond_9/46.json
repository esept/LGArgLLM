Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The justifications focus on the presence of cystic configurations of anaplastic squamous and mucoid cells as characteristic of mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which aligns with the patient's clinical presentation and history (e.g., painless slow-growing mass, facial weakness, and prior radiation exposure). The overlap in meaning between the justifications confirms a shared basis for the claim.
