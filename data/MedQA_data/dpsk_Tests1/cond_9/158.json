Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While all arguments agree that the mechanism of action is not blocking the sodium/potassium ATPase pump, they provide different reasons and alternative mechanisms (e.g., adenosine's effect on AV node, disruption of normal cardiac function, re-entrant tachycardia treatment). There is no single shared semantic basis across all justifications that supports the claim.
