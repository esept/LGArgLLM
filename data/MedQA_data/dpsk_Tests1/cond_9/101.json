Result: true  
Justification: All justifications consistently argue that the patient's symptoms and findings (bloody diarrhea, liver abscesses, travel history) are characteristic of Entamoeba histolytica infection and not associated with acid-fast cysts. They collectively reject the claim that acid-fast cysts would be seen in this patient, based on the same clinical and diagnostic reasoning.
