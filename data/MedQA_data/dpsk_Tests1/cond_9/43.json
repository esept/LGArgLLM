Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the P-type arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on the timing of symptoms relative to penicillin therapy, while the second justification emphasizes the patient's predisposition to allergic reactions due to his medical history. These are distinct lines of reasoning that do not intersect semantically to form a unified support for the claim.
