Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that oral prednisone is the most appropriate next step in treatment. Instead, they collectively argue against the use of oral prednisone and suggest alternative diagnoses (e.g., von Willebrand disease) or management strategies (e.g., diagnostic testing, desmopressin, antifibrinolytics). There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim.
