Result: true  
Justification: Both justifications for the P-type arguments share a common semantic core: hexamethonium prevents the decrease in heart rate (bradycardia) by blocking pathways that would otherwise lead to parasympathetic slowing of the heart. The first justification focuses on blocking autonomic ganglia to prevent reflex bradycardia, while the second emphasizes blocking muscarinic receptors to prevent parasympathetic slowing. Both converge on the idea of hexamethonium stabilizing heart rate by inhibiting parasympathetic mechanisms.
