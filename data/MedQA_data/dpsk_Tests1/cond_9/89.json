Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim that topical benzoyl peroxide is the most appropriate initial treatment for the patient's mild acne. The justifications consistently highlight benzoyl peroxide's effectiveness for mild acne (open comedones), its first-line status, safety profile, and suitability for a young patient with no prior treatment. This shared basis collectively supports the claim.
