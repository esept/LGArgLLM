Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim (thyrotoxic crisis). Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by pointing to alternative diagnoses (pulmonary embolism, fat embolism syndrome) and highlighting the absence of typical thyrotoxic crisis symptoms. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim itself.
