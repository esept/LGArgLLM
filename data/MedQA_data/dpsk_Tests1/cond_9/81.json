Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification suggests plausibility due to rounding or measurement error, while the second justification hypothesizes about a larger dataset or statistical adjustments. These are distinct and non-overlapping reasons, so there is no shared semantic basis for the claim.
