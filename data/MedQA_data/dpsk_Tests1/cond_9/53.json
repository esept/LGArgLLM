Result: true  
Justification: Both justifications focus on the mechanism by which succinylcholine can cause cardiac arrhythmias in burn patients, specifically through hyperkalemia and upregulation of acetylcholine receptors. The semantic core of both arguments is the link between succinylcholine, hyperkalemia, and cardiac arrhythmias in the context of burn injuries, thus supporting the same basis for the claim.
