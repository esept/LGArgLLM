Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that increased vaginal pH is the strongest predisposing factor. Instead, they collectively argue against this claim by pointing out that the vaginal pH is normal (4.3), that candidiasis thrives in acidic environments, and that other factors (IUD, antibiotic use, douching) are more relevant. There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim.
