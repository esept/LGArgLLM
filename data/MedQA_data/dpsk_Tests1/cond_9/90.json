Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core centered around the mechanism of action of Isoproterenol as a beta-adrenergic agonist (specifically acting on beta-2 receptors) to relax bronchial smooth muscle, which is relevant for treating both asthma (the boy's condition) and COPD (the grandfather's condition). The justifications consistently highlight this pharmacological mechanism as the basis for the drug's similarity to the prescribed medication.
