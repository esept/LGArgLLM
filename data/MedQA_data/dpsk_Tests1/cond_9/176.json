Result: true  
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic core linking the newborn's condition to hyperinsulinemia. The first argument connects maternal gestational diabetes and large birth weight to fetal hyperinsulinemia, the second ties the clinical symptoms to neonatal hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinemia, and the third rules out other causes, reinforcing the metabolic (hyperinsulinemia) basis. The intersection is the consistent focus on hyperinsulinemia as the underlying cause of the newborn's symptoms.
