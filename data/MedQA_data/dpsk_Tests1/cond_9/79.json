Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim that verapamil is the appropriate treatment. They both cite the patient's symptoms (syncope during exertion), family history of sudden cardiac death, and the effectiveness of verapamil in managing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or preventing lethal arrhythmias. The justifications overlap in meaning and collectively support the same basis for the claim.
