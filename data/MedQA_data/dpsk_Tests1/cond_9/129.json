Result: true  
Justification: All three P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications all point to features (thrombocytosis, hypercalcemia, systemic symptoms) that are indicative of a myeloproliferative disorder, which is strongly associated with JAK2 mutations. The overlap in meaning across the justifications provides a consistent and unified basis for the claim.
