Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core pointing to the need for karyotyping due to the patient's primary hypogonadism (elevated FSH, Tanner stage 1) and the likelihood of a genetic etiology (e.g., Turner syndrome), excluding other causes like nutritional deficiencies or medication effects. The arguments collectively support the claim that karyotype is the next best diagnostic step.
