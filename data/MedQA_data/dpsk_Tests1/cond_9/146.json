Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While all arguments agree that a cardiac stress test is not appropriate, they propose different confirmatory tests (biopsy, serum free light chain assay, cardiac MRI, technetium pyrophosphate scan, endomyocardial biopsy, serum or urine protein electrophoresis, genetic testing) without a unified semantic basis for the claim.
