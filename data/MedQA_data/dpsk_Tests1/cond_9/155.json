Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the physiological changes during exercise, specifically increased CO2 production and its effects on blood pH and pCO2 levels. Each argument supports the claim by explaining different aspects of the same underlying mechanism (increased metabolic activity and ventilation during exercise).
