Result: true  
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications all focus on the mechanism of decreased release of progeny virus as the likely contributor to the efficacy of the patient's pharmacotherapy. They mention ribavirin or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) inhibiting viral replication or RNA synthesis, which aligns with the claim's focus on decreased release of progeny virus.
