Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a single semantic core. While they all discuss the impact of the increased [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio on the reaction, they focus on different mechanisms (e.g., diversion to malate, inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase, shift in hepatic redox state, and indirect effects on gluconeogenic flux). There is no single, shared semantic basis across all justifications.
