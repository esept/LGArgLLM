Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on the duration of symptoms fitting the subacute range, the second on the absence of severe symptoms ruling out other conditions, and the third on the patient's healthy status making atypical infections less likely. While all support the claim, they do so based on different aspects of the clinical presentation rather than a shared semantic basis.
