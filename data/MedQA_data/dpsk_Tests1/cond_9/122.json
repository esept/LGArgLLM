Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that non-selective beta-blockers (antagonists of ß1 and ß2 adrenergic receptors) are effective in managing the patient's condition by reducing portal venous pressure through dual blockade mechanisms. The first argument emphasizes the standard use and overall effect, while the second argument details the specific mechanisms (ß2 blockade in splanchnic circulation and ß1-mediated cardiac output reduction). Both justifications support the same underlying rationale for the claim.
