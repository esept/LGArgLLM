Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that dantrolene caused prolonged muscle paralysis. Instead, they collectively argue against dantrolene being the cause, citing its mechanism of action and typical uses, while suggesting other more plausible explanations (e.g., succinylcholine in pseudocholinesterase deficiency). There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim.
