Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. One justification focuses on the weak positive correlation (0.11), while the other emphasizes the statistical significance (p-value 0.006). These are distinct aspects of the study results and do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
