Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While all arguments address neurological symptoms and lesion locations, they diverge in their conclusions about the specific additional findings (ptosis and inability to look up with the right eye). Some arguments explicitly state that these symptoms are not consistent with the lesion described, while others focus on unrelated neurological findings. There is no shared semantic basis across all justifications that supports the claim.
