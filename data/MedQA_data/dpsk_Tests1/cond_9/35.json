Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the mechanism of action of angiogenesis inhibitors (e.g., lenalidomide or thalidomide derivatives) and their effects on wound healing, mucosal breakdown, and fistula formation in the context of multiple myeloma treatment. Each justification supports the claim by explaining how inhibition of angiogenesis leads to the patient's symptoms.
