Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by pointing out that flecainide does not match the described pharmacological effects (e.g., it does not prolong action potential duration or QT interval) and is unlikely to be prescribed in this clinical scenario. Each justification provides a different reason why flecainide is not the correct answer, rather than supporting the claim.
