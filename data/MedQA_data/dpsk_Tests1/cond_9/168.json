Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument states that vasa previa is unrelated to oxytocin administration, while the second argument discusses the patient's mental health history, which is irrelevant to vasa previa. There is no intersection in meaning between the justifications that collectively supports the claim.
