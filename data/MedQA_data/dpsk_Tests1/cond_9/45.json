Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share the common semantic core that the drug recommended (isotretinoin) has a molecular structure resembling drugs used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (specifically all-trans retinoic acid or ATRA). The justifications consistently highlight isotretinoin's structural similarity to retinoic acid derivatives, its teratogenicity (necessitating oral contraceptives), and its use for severe acne, all of which support the claim.
