Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on the severity and persistence of symptoms (daily difficulty breathing and frequent nighttime awakenings), while the second justification emphasizes the reduced forced expiratory volume. Although both relate to the severity of asthma, they address different aspects (symptoms vs. lung function) and do not intersect semantically to form a unified basis for the claim of status asthmaticus.
