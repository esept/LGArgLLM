Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first argument highlights the patient's increased risk for hospital-acquired infections (including UTIs) due to recent surgery, septic shock, and ICU stay, which could have been mitigated by prophylactic ciprofloxacin. The second argument focuses on the absence of costovertebral angle tenderness, suggesting a lower UTI where prophylactic ciprofloxacin would be effective. Both justifications converge on the idea that prophylactic ciprofloxacin would have likely prevented the UTI in this patient, thus supporting the same semantic basis for the claim.
