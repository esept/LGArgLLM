Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core linking the clinical presentation (meconium ileus, inspissated meconium plugs, microcolon) to cystic fibrosis (CF), which in turn is associated with infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) or obstructive azoospermia. The justifications overlap in their reasoning and support the claim consistently.
