Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core: the patient's recurrent infections, family history of similar infections in male members, and normal standard immune tests strongly suggest an inherited immunodeficiency disorder (specifically leukocyte adhesion deficiency or similar), warranting flow cytometry for CD18+ cell deficiency. The justifications consistently point to this shared reasoning.
