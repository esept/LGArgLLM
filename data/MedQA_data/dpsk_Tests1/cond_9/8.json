Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments' justifications center around thiamine deficiency leading to impaired alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and dietary history. The first argument directly links the symptoms to thiamine deficiency affecting the enzyme, while the second explains how the patient's diet leads to this deficiency. Both justifications support the same semantic basis for the claim.
