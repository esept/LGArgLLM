Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim of asbestosis. While they mention factors like occupational exposure, absence of infectious symptoms, and chronicity, none of them directly link these factors to asbestosis specifically. The arguments are supportive but do not intersect on a single semantic basis for the claim.
