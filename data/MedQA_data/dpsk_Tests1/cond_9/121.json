Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While the first three arguments discuss life-threatening complications of amobarbital withdrawal (seizures, autonomic instability, delirium/psychosis), the fourth argument contradicts the claim by stating that internal bleeding is not a recognized complication. There is no intersection in meaning that collectively supports the claim.
