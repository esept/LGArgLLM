Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not relate to the claim about the mechanism underlying temporal muscle atrophy in a patient with stage IV lung cancer. Instead, they discuss historical attire of ninjas, which is entirely unrelated to the medical claim. There is no common semantic intersection between the justifications and the claim.
