Result: true  
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic core linking the patient's symptoms (malar rash, photosensitivity, joint pain, oral ulcers) and family history of autoimmune disease to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can involve salivary gland inflammation (e.g., secondary Sj√∂gren's syndrome). The justifications collectively support the plausibility of immunologically mediated destruction of the salivary glands in this context.
