Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim (Holter monitoring). Instead, they collectively argue against Holter monitoring and suggest alternative diagnostic tests (e.g., echocardiogram, right heart catheterization) based on the patient's symptoms and findings. There is no intersection in the justifications that supports Holter monitoring as the logical diagnostic test.
