  "claim": "A 64-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of intermittent epigastric discomfort. He reports that his urine has been very dark, and his stools have been pale for the past week. His appetite has decreased, and he has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during this period. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks a few shots of vodka daily. He has no history of severe illness. He has chronic left knee pain, for which he takes acetaminophen. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus. There are scratch marks on the extremities. Abdominal examination shows a nontender, palpable mass in the right upper quadrant. The remainder of the examination is normal. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11.6 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 8,700/mm3\nPlatelet count 172,000/mm3\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 17 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nBilirubin\nTotal 6 mg/dL\nDirect 5.2 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 220 IU/L\nUltrasonography shows dilated extrahepatic and pancreatic ducts and a distended gall bladder.
