  "claim": "A 6-week-old boy is brought to see his pediatrician. His mother says that he has not been feeding well and forcefully vomited after every feed over the past 4 days. The infant was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. However, a week after delivery he developed a respiratory infection involving an aggressive cough followed by a high-pitched intake of breath. Respiratory cultures were positive for a gram-negative coccobacilli for which he received erythromycin. Since then he has remained healthy until now. On examination, the infant\u2019s vitals are normal but he appears lethargic and mildly dehydrated with depressed fontanelles and decreased skin turgor. A firm non-tender mass is palpated in the epigastric region. Which of the following is most likely a cause of this baby\u2019s symptoms? : Inadequate myenteric plexus innervation",
