  "claim": "A 45-year-old man presents to the clinic for the third time in the past 3 weeks asking for an MRI of his lower back. He had initially gone to the gym as advised by his wife and had started doing some back exercises. The next day, he developed soreness in his lower back and spent the whole day online trying to figure out what was wrong with him. He has been to the emergency department a few times and subsequently has been redirected to the clinic where each time he was thoroughly examined and investigated for all the possible causes. The patient still exhibits worry and would like to get an MRI to make sure everything is \u2018okay.\u2019 Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? : Illness anxiety disorder",
