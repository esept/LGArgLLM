  "claim": "A 19-year-old female college student comes to the physician for a sudden loss of visual acuity of her right eye. She noticed that she was unable to read the time on the alarm clock when she woke up in the morning. When she closes her right eye, she is able to see sharply. When she closes her left eye, she has blurry double vision. She does not recall trauma to her eye but has been working long nights on her honors thesis. She has a history of occasional shoulder luxation. She is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall, and weighs 62 kg (136 lbs); her BMI is 19.1 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, slender and long fingers are noted. She has several flat, demarcated brownish nevi on her left cheek. Ocular examination shows upward temporal subluxation of her right lens. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? : Joint hypermobility syndrome",
