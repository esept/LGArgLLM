  "claim": "A 48-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of persistent cough productive of white phlegm. He coughs consistently throughout the day, and he has not noticed any particular triggers that make it worse. He has also recently experienced some shortness of breath with exertion. He has not had any weight loss, fever, or chills. He had similar symptoms last year, which lasted about 6 months. He has hypertension, for which he takes amlodipine. He has worked in construction for the past 10 years. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an end-expiratory wheeze throughout all lung zones. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? : Asbestosis",
