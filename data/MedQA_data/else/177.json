  "claim": "A 19-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after experiencing a first-time seizure. She as preparing for an exam at her college\u2019s library, in her normal state of health and collapsed. When she regained consciousness she was surrounded by students and staff. The emergency personnel assessed her condition and brought her in. Past medical history is significant for major depressive disorder. Her primary care physician prescribed a medication for her depression, but she has not taken it for several days because she was concerned about weight gain. Family medical history is insignificant for neurological disorders. Instead, for the past 10 days, she has been taking her roommate\u2019s antidepressant medication instead. Today her blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg, pulse 102/min, respirations 12/min and he BMI is 15 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals pale and dry mucosa and conjunctiva, and lanugo on her arms and legs. What medication is the patient most likely taking? : Gabapentin",
