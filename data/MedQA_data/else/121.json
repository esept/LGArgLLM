  "claim": "A 46-year-old anesthesiologist is found placing several syringes of amobarbital in his backpack prior to leaving the hospital. When confronted, the anesthesiologist admits that he began abusing the medication the previous year, after his divorce was finalized. He has been using it on a daily basis since then, and his most recent usage was 8 hours ago. Which of the following is the most life-threatening complication of amobarbital withdrawal? : Internal bleeding",
