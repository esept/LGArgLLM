  "claim": "A 24-year-old woman with no past medical history presents to her PCP for a routine checkup. She feels generally healthy but has noticed a new vaginal discharge that has a strange odor. The patient has been in a long-term relationship and denies any new sexual partners. She denies vaginal itching, abnormal menstruation, or dyspareunia. Vital signs are within normal limits. The physical exam reveals thin, greyish-white vaginal discharge but is otherwise unremarkable. A sample of this discharge is collected. What would be the most likely finding on wet mount? : Epithelial cells with stippling",
