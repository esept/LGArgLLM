  "claim": "A 29-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of progressive numbness and weakness in her right arm and right leg for 1 day. Two months ago, she had blurry vision and headache for a week, which resolved without treatment. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 115/71 mm Hg. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the right arm and leg and 5/5 on the left side. MRI of the brain shows gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the left central sulcus, cervical spinal cord, and optic nerve. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy is started. This drug is most likely to result in which of the following laboratory changes? : Eosinopenia",
