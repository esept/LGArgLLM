  "claim": "A 48-year-old woman presents to the doctor\u2019s office complaining of frequent episodes of severe heartburn and chest pain. It feels like food is getting stuck in her throat somewhere. She wakes up at night in fits of coughing and in pain. Antacids and other over the counter remedies do not improve the discomfort. The physician feels that the patient has acid reflux and recommends upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and a trial of omeprazole. Several biopsies are taken during the endoscopy: one from the distal esophagus, one from the gastroesophageal junction, and one from the body of the stomach. Which histological finding would place her at the highest risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma in the near future? : The presence of stratified squamous epithelium at the Z line",
