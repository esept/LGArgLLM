  "claim": "A 32-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for generalized fatigue. She states that she is doing well but that she always feels tired. She started exercising to have more energy, finds that she tires easily, and has not felt motivated to return to the gym. She is doing well and is excelling at her job.
