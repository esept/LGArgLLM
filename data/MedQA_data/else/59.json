  "claim": "A 30-year-old male biology graduate student was dismissed from his PhD program after 8 years because he was not able to produce a thesis, claiming that his data was never exactly how he wanted it. He would spend weeks planning out a simple experiment, since everything had to be just right. For many experiments, he would start over because he felt he went out of order in adding the reagents to his media for his cells. He has had similar problems in his undergraduate courses, often failing to complete his assignments on time because he had to revise them until they were perfect. Which of the following disorders does this patient potentially suffer from? : Paranoid personality disorder",
