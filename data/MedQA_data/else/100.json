  "claim": "A 64-year-old woman comes to the physician because of several episodes of dizziness during the last month. The episodes last between 30\u201340 seconds and during the episodes she feels as though she is spinning. Episodes usually occur immediately after lying down or suddenly sitting up from a reclined position. They also sometimes happen when she suddenly turns her head to look at something. She has no nausea. Last month, she had an upper respiratory tract infection that resolved spontaneously. She has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Otoscopic examination shows no abnormalities. There is no lateralization when a vibrating 512 Hz tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? : Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo",
