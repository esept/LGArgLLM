He was born at 34 weeks' gestation. He appears irritable. His temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 161/min, respirations are 56/min, and blood pressure is 62/44 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended abdomen; there is diffuse tenderness to palpation over the abdomen. Bowel sounds are decreased. Digital rectal examination is unremarkable. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated bowel loops. Contrast enema demonstrates inspissated meconium plugs in the distal ileum and microcolon. Which of the following is the child most likely to develop? : Infertility",
