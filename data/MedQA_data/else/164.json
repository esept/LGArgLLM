He came back from his honeymoon in Kenya 6 months ago. He appears ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). He is alert and oriented to person, time, and place. Physical examination shows generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 2,900/mm3, and platelet count of 108,000/mm3.
