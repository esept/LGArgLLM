He is at the 20th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. Physical examination shows an enlarged tongue. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The liver is palpated 1 cm below the right costal margin. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone in the extremities. Serum glucose is 105 mg/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows cardiomegaly.
