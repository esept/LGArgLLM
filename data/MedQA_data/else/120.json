He states that he has spent the majority of the last year alone in his room \u201cworking on a project at home to save the earth from an evil alien power.\u201d There is no family history of serious illness. He has smoked marijuana on a daily basis since he was thirteen. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, he has a flat affect and his speech is disorganized.
