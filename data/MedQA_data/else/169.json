  "claim": "A 57-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with heart palpitations and shortness of breath. On exam, he is tachycardic and his rhythm is irregularly irregular. He fails standard pharmacologic therapy and you refer to cardiology, where he is started on an antiarrhythmic medication. The action of this agent results in a longer action potential duration, an increased effective refractory period, and a longer QT interval. Which drug has been prescribed? : Flecanide",
