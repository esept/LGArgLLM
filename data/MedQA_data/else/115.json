The patient was at a friend's house, and he was bitten when he pulled the dog's tail while it was eating. The patient is currently doing well and has a dog bite on his right distal forearm. His temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, pulse is 123/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The wound is thoroughly irrigated in the emergency department. Which of the following is the best next step in management? : Quarantine and observe the animal",
