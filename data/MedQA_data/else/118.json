  "claim": "An 8-year-old girl is brought by her mother to her pediatrician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. She was diagnosed with asthma about 4 years ago and has been on medications ever since. She came into the doctor\u2019s office about a month ago with an escalation of her symptoms. She told her doctor that she has been struggling to breathe almost every single day. This difficulty increased when she played outdoors with her friends. She said that she used to wake up at least 3 times a week from sleep to use her inhaler. She uses a short-acting \u03b2-agonist inhaler to control her symptoms. At the previous visit, her doctor had started her on a small dose of fluticasone (inhaled) as well as a long-acting \u03b2-agonist inhaler. She has some improvement in her symptoms. On physical examination, she doesn\u2019t seem to be in distress, and currently, the lungs are clear on auscultation. Her forced expiratory volume in one second is about 70% of the predicted value. Based on the description of these patients symptoms and current treatment regime, which of the following categories describes the severity of this child\u2019s symptoms? : Status asthmaticus",
