He has obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His only medication is metformin. He appears anxious. He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 114 kg (251 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 96/min and blood pressure is 124/86 mm Hg. Examination shows facial acne. A cyst is seen above the natal cleft. There is tenderness to palpation at the cyst and surrounding tissue. The skin around the cyst is warm and erythematous. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? : Incision and drainage",
