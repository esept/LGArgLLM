  "claim": "A 34-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of weakness and rash for the past 2 months. She says her symptoms had a gradual onset at first, but over the past 2 weeks she has grown more concerned as she now has difficulty going up and down the stairs in her apartment. Her rash is nonpruritic and confined to her knuckles. She denies fever, chills, and changes in bowel habits, cough, or shortness of breath. Up until the onset of her symptoms she had been an avid hiker in upstate New York. Temperature is 98.0\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C) blood pressure is 110/72 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination demonstrates 4-/5 strength in the proximal lower extremities. The patient's cutaneous findings are demonstrated in figure A. Laboratory studies will most likely demonstrate the following in this patient? : Anti-histone antibodies",
