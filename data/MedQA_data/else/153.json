  "claim": "A 40-year-old man presents to a clinic for a regular follow-up. He was diagnosed with Wilson\u2019s disease 20 years ago and underwent a human leukocyte antigen\u2013matched liver transplant 15 years ago. Today he is feeling fine and has no complaints except for a new, mild jaundice that his wife noticed a few weeks ago. He denies any changes in stool or urine color and is not having any abdominal pain. On physical examination, his vital signs are within normal limits, and only mild scleral icterus is noticed. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of rejection that happened in this patient? : Donor allogeneic MHC molecules are taken up by recipient APCs and processed into peptides, and then the peptides are presented by recipient MHC molecules to donor T cells.",
