  "claim": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with weakness of her legs which has progressed to an inability for her to stand. The patient works as a school teacher in Alaska and regularly goes hiking and camping. She recently returned from a camping trip where she hiked through tall brush and drank from mountain streams. The patient was also involved in a motor vehicle accident 2 days ago but did not seek treatment. The patient has a medical history that is unremarkable and is currently taking multivitamins and other than a recent bout of diarrhea is generally healthy. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a very anxious woman with 1/5 strength of the patient\u2019s lower extremities and 2/5 strength of her trunk muscles with diminished sensation. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 15 g/dL\nHematocrit: 43%\nLeukocyte count: 6,500/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 194,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 138 mEq/L\nCl-: 102 mEq/L\nK+: 4.4 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 120 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.0 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\npH: 7.44\nPaCO2: 10 mmHg\nPaO2: 90 mmHg\nAST: 12 U/L\nALT: 10 U/L\n\nThe patient complains about difficulty breathing. Repeat laboratory values are notable for the findings below.\n\npH: 7.35\nPaCO2: 30 mmHg\nPaO2: 80 mmHg\n\nThe patient is intubated and sent to the MICU. Which of the following risk factors is associated with the most likely diagnosis? : Consuming meats cooked over a campfire",
