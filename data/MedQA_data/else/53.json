  "claim": "A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with second- and third-degree burns covering 30% of the surface area of his body. He is alert and active. He has no personal or family history of serious illness. His temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), pulse is 62/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 2 liters by nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Intravenous fluids, intravenous and topical antibiotics, and intravenous pain medications are administered in the intensive care unit. Twenty-four hours later, the patient develops respiratory distress. Respirations are 30/min. There is an inspiratory stridor. The patient requires rapid sequence intubation. Administering succinylcholine during this procedure would most likely result in which of the following complications? : Cardiac arrhythmia",
