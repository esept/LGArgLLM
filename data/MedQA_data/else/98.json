  "claim": "A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of severe central chest pain, mild shortness of breath, and one episode of coughing up blood since waking up that morning. The pain worsens on inspiration, and she describes it as 8 out of 10 in intensity. Three months ago, she underwent a left modified radical mastectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 103/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 102/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The left lower extremity is swollen and erythematous. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, and a creatinine clearance of 81 mL/min (N = 75\u2013115). Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:\npH 7.49\nPCO2 29 mm Hg\nPO2 69 mm Hg\nHCO3- 22 mEq/L\nAn x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\" : CT pulmonary angiography",
