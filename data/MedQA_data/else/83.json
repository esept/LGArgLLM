  "claim": "A 55-year-old African American man presents to the emergency department with central chest pressure. His symptoms started 1 day before. The pain was initially intermittent in nature but has become constant and radiates to his jaw and left shoulder. He also complains of some difficulty breathing. The patient was diagnosed with essential hypertension 1 year ago, but he is not taking any medications for it. The patient denies smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Family history is unremarkable. His blood pressure is 230/130 mm Hg in both arms, the temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), and the pulse is 90/min. ECG shows diffuse T wave inversion and ST depression in lateral leads. Laboratory testing is significant for elevated troponin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? : Aortic aneurysm",
