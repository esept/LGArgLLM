  "claim": "A 40-year-old woman presents to the physician with complaints of frequent headaches and fatigue for a month. Her headaches are mild and occur at random times. They are relieved by over the counter analgesics. Furthermore, she feels tired most of the time and sometimes gets short of breath with exertion. She denies low mood, loss of interest, inability to concentrate, sleep disturbance, or suicidal ideation. She was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 20 years ago for which she currently takes methotrexate. Additionally, she takes a folic acid-containing multivitamin daily. Her medical history is otherwise insignificant and she does not smoke, drink, or use recreational drugs. She has a pulse rate of 110/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals pallor in her palms and lower palpebral conjunctiva. Which of the following arterial blood findings for the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygen saturation (SaO2), and oxygen concentration (CaO2) are expected in this patient? : Normal PaO2, normal SaO2, normal CaO2",
