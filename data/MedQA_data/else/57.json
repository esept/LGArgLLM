  "claim": "A 46-year-old man presents to his physician because of persistent pelvic and scrotal pain for the past month. He also has had occasional fevers, chills, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency over the last few months. He was prescribed trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for the urinary symptoms, but he is still having symptoms currently. He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. The patient has hypertension and takes lisinopril.  He also takes PrEP (Truvada, which contains tenofovir and emtricitabine). On physical exam, his temperature is 36.7\u2103 (98.1\u2109), the blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 74/min, and the respirations are 14/min. A digital rectal exam reveals a mildly tender and mildly enlarged prostate. Urine specimens are sent for culture and sensitivity testing. A urine sample taken after prostate massage shows a 10-fold increase in bacteria counts. The test results for antimicrobial sensitivity include ampicillin, cefepime, gentamicin, levofloxacin, and meropenem. The patient is prescribed tamsulosin. Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic to pair with the tamsulosin? : Levofloxacin",
