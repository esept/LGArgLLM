  "claim": "A 51-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe pain while urinating for 4 days. He has also had to urinate more often than usual. Three weeks ago, he underwent surgery for an incarcerated hernia. While recovering, he developed septic shock and was treated in the intensive care unit. He was discharged 6 days ago. He has a history of hypertension. Current medications include amlodipine and oxycodone. He appears anxious. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 96/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic area; no guarding is present. There is a well-healed surgical scar in the right inguinal region. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows:\nBlood 1+\nProtein 1+\nNitrite positive\nLeukocyte esterase positive\nRBC 1\u20132/hpf\nWBC 20\u201325/hpf\nWhich of the following would have most likely prevented this complication?\" : Prophylactic oral ciprofloxacin",
