He works as a commercial fisherman on Lake Superior. Current medications include metoprolol and warfarin. His temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 96/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 98/62 mm Hg. Examination shows increased fremitus and bronchial breath sounds over the right middle lung field. An x-ray of the chest shows consolidation of the right upper lobe.
