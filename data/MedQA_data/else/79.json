  "claim": "A 27-year-old woman is brought to the physician after passing out at home. Her husband reports that she suddenly lost consciousness for approximately 30 seconds while shoveling snow in the driveway. Immediately before the episode, she felt light-headed and short of breath. Two months ago, she experienced a similar episode while running in her yard with her children. She has no history of serious illness. Her father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 44 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiac examination shows a systolic ejection murmur best heard along the left sternal border that decreases with hand grip. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient? : Verapamil",
