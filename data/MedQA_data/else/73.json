  "claim": "A 78-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, status-post bilateral mastectomy, presents to the emergency department with progressive difficulty breathing, worsening fatigue, and 5 pounds of unintended weight loss over the past month. A portable chest x-ray reveals a massive right pleural effusion. The ED resident performs thoracentesis with chest tube placement and admits her to the floor. Overnight, the patient requests multiple pain medications for right upper abdominal pain and is found to have increasingly sanguinous drainage. Where was the thoracentesis needle most likely placed? : Lower border of the 9th rib at the right midaxillary line",
