Physical examination is significant for profound jaundice and tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The patient returned 2 weeks ago from a 1 month-long trip to India. She received sporadic pre-natal care while traveling and reports no known complications in her current pregnancy to date. She denies any past medical problems and states that her prior pregnancy proceeded as a normal vaginal birth without any complications. Infection with which of the following organisms would portend the worst prognosis with the highest mortality rate for this patient? : Hepatitis B",
