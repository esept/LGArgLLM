  "claim": "A 4-year-old girl from a recently immigrated family presents to the emergency department with episodes of severe coughing lasting up to several minutes followed by vomiting. She had a low grade fever and runny nose over the last 2 weeks but these coughing episodes just began one day prior to presentation. A complete blood count shows a lymphocytic infiltrate and Gram stain reveals a gram-negative coccobacillus. The emergency department physician explains that this organism causes disease by toxin-mediated inactivation of an inhibitory signaling molecule. Which of the following could be used to culture the most likely cause of this disorder? : Charcoal yeast with iron and cysteine",
