  "claim": "Please refer to the summary above to answer this question\nAn 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination at a clinic for low-income residents. Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. Both the son's maternal and paternal grandmothers have major depressive disorder. The mother is curious about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?\" : High-quality afterschool programming for low-income 8-year-olds may correlate with decreased bipolar disorder risk in adults.",
