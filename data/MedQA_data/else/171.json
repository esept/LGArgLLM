  "claim": "A 53-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife after the sudden onset of dizziness, nausea, and left-sided weakness. His blood pressure is 165/95 mm Hg. Neurological examination shows decreased muscle tone and hyperreflexia in the right upper and lower extremities. His gait is unsteady, and he falls to the left when attempting to walk. Finger-to-nose testing shows dysmetria on the left side. A CT scan of the head shows a small lesion in the left lateral pons that involves the nucleus of a cranial nerve that exits the brain at the middle cerebellar peduncle. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient? : Ptosis and inability to look up with the right eye",
