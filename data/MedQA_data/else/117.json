  "claim": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician because of urinary straining and delayed flow of urine for 1 month. She has a medical history significant for long-standing asthma. Recently, she has been taking albuterol more frequently on an as-needed basis. She was diagnosed with major depression last year. Currently, her symptoms of depression are under control. Her medications include inhaled salmeterol and fluticasone propionate and oral amitriptyline, the dose of which was increased recently due to uncontrolled depressive symptoms. The vital signs include: temperature 37.1\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse rate 80/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, she has dry oral mucous membranes. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate modification in this patient\u2019s drug therapy? : Adding ipratropium bromide inhaler",
