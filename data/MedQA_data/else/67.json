  "claim": "A 34-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 2, para 0, at 28 weeks of gestation presents to the physician for a prenatal visit. She has not had regular prenatal care. Her most recent abdominal ultrasound was at 20 weeks of gestation, and it confirmed accurate fetal dates and appropriate fetal development. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She used to work as a nurse before she emigrated from Brazil 13 years ago. She lost her immunization records during the move and cannot recall all of her vaccinations. She appears well. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination reveals a fundal height of 26 cm. No abnormalities are found during the physical exam. An ELISA test conducted for HIV is negative. Serology test results for hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis C antibody are positive for both. The laboratory test results for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis A antibody are negative. The polymerase chain reaction analysis of hepatitis C RNA is positive for genotype 1. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time? : Plan to formula feed the newborn",
