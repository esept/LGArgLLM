  "claim": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after he was struck by a car while crossing the road. He is found to have a femur fracture and multiple bruises on presentation, but he is alert and hemodynamically stable. He says that the car \"came out of nowhere\" and that he has had multiple similar near misses in recent months. He has no past medical history but says that he has been having headaches that he describes as dull and continuous. He has also noticed that he has been waking up at night several times to go to the restroom. Otherwise, he has been healthy with no major concerns. A basic metabolic panel shows mild hypernatremia. The most likely pathology underlying this patient's symptoms is derived from which of the following embryonic layers? : Endoderm",
