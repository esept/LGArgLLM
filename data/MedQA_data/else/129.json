  "claim": "A 50-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician because of right elbow pain for the past 12 hours. The pain is currently at 7 out of 10 in intensity. She has not had any trauma to the right elbow. She also reports general malaise. She had a miscarriage at the age of 37 years. One year ago, she had carpal tunnel syndrome that was treated with a volar splint. Three months ago, she was diagnosed with thrombophlebitis, which responded well to treatment with ibuprofen and compression therapy. She runs 5 km (3.1 miles) per week. She works as an accountant. She drinks 1\u20132 glasses of wine on weekends. She is 171 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lbs); BMI is 23.9 kg/m2. Her pulse is 110/min, blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). On physical examination, the skin above her right elbow is erythematous and severely tender to palpation. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.5 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 9,520/mm3\nPlatelet count 853,000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 136 mEq/L\nK+ 3.7 mEq/L\nCl- 96 mEq/L\nCa2+ 11.0 mg/dL\nHCO3- 25 mEq/L\nGlucose 102 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.0 mg/dL\nUric acid 10.5 mg/dL\nFurther evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following? : Mutation in Janus kinase 2 gene",
