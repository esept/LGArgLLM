  "claim": "A 26-year-old female with no significant past medical history presents to the emergency department complaining of chest pain. She states that she was visiting her boyfriend in the hospital and, approximately 10 minutes ago, she developed chest pain associated with sweating, palpitations, nausea, and chills. She appears very nervous and states that she is scared that she is dying. Vital signs reveal tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. An EKG is obtained that is unremarkable besides tachycardia. TSH and free T4 are within normal limits. A urine drug screen is obtained and it is negative. What is the best immediate treatment for this patient? : Albuterol breathing treatment",
