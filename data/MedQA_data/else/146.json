  "claim": "A 59-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because of shortness of breath. She has been experiencing an increasing inability to breathe following strenuous activity. This includes climbing stairs and walking a few blocks down the street. During the day, her breathing becomes more pronounced when she takes her a nap or lies down to sleep at night. Another concerning symptom is the increased swelling in her legs. She has a history of few episodes of syncope. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The vital signs include: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 90/min, and respiratory rate 18/min. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows low voltage. Echocardiography shows granular speckling with concentric thickening of the ventricular walls, more prominently of the right wall. Which of the following confirmatory tests is most appropriate? : Cardiac stress test",
