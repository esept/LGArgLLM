  "claim": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician by his parents. The parents say that the patient accidentally instilled a drop from a bottle of medicated eye drops into his right eye. According to them, the patient\u2019s grandfather uses the eye drops which were prescribed for him by an ophthalmologist. The parents have brought the eye drops with them. The pediatrician notes that the eye drops contain an \u03b11 adrenergic agonist drug. He examines the patient\u2019s eye and finds that the eye drops have produced their expected effects. He reassures the parents about the self-limited effect of the drug and the absence of any risk of long-term complications. Which of the following effects are most likely to have occurred in this child\u2019s eye from these eye drops? : Relaxation of the pupillary dilator muscle with no effect on the ciliary muscle",
