  "claim": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of progressive weakness and numbness for 3 months. The symptoms started in her lower legs and gradually moved to her upper legs and arms. During the last 5 days, she has also had bilateral facial weakness with headaches. She has hepatitis B and Graves' disease. She is sexually active with one male partner and they use condoms inconsistently. Her current medications include methimazole and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is alert and fully oriented. She has bilateral upper and lower facial paralysis. There is generalized weakness of the muscles. Sensation to light touch is decreased throughout and is absent in her fingertips and toes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings? : Positive Lyme ELISA test",
