His parents note that he has never had an episode of diarrhea like this previously, but that several other children at his daycare had been ill recently. The blood pressure is 112/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 94/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). The physical exam is significant for preauricular adenopathy.
