The lesion began as a small papule and then became a blister that has since ulcerated. Her temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Examination shows a black eschar with edematous borders on the left upper arm. There is axillary lymphadenopathy. The virulence factor responsible for the edema seen in this patient has a mechanism of action similar to which of the following enzymes? : Catalase",
