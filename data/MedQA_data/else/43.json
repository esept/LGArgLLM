  "claim": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a progressive rash for 2 days. The rash started behind the ears and now involves the trunk and extremities. Over the past 4 days, he has had mild sore throat, red, itchy eyes, and headache. He was born at term and has been healthy except for recurrent episodes of tonsillitis and occasional asthma attacks. Two weeks ago, he was treated for tonsillitis that resolved with penicillin therapy. He immigrated with his family from Brazil 3 weeks ago. His immunization status is unknown. The patient appears weak and lethargic. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows postauricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy. There is a non-confluent, pink maculopapular rash over the torso and extremities. His palms and soles show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? : Allergic drug reaction",
