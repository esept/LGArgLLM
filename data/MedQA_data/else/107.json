  "claim": "A 25-year-old woman presents to the urgent care clinic for cough for the past five days. She recently moved to the area and has not yet established a primary care doctor. She has noticed worsening runny nose with congestion, sneezing, and tearing over the past few days. She initially thought that it was just due to dust from moving boxes into her new apartment, but her symptoms did not improve after cleaning her belongings and vacuuming her floor. She feels some relief after splashing her face with cold water, but her symptoms recur within ten minutes. She has no pets and does not take any medications. Her physical exam reveals examples of findings shown in Figures A-C. No rales or wheezes are appreciated on lung auscultation, but bronchial breath sounds are heard at the bases. The patient states that she will need to drive back home after this visit. What is the best initial step in management? : Intravenous diphenhydramine",
