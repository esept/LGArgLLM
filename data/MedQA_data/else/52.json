  "claim": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for evaluation after falling. He has fallen multiple times in the last year. His parents report that he did not walk until he was 18 months old. Examination shows a mildly swollen right ankle with no tenderness over the medial or lateral malleolus; range of motion is full with mild pain. He has marked enlargement of both calves. When standing up, the patient uses his hands against his knees and thighs to slowly push himself up into a standing position. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's fall? : Myotonin protein kinase defect",
