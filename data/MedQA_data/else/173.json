His younger sister was recently diagnosed with endometrial cancer, and his mother was diagnosed with gastric cancer at 58 years of age. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. Colonoscopy shows a tumor in the ascending colon. Histopathologic examination of the tumor shows a mucinous, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
