  "claim": "A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a slightly itchy rash that first appeared 3 days ago. Her mother says she has also been complaining of headaches and achy muscles since yesterday evening. The girl went on a camping trip for school 10 days ago. She recalls being bitten several times by mosquitoes. She has a history of atopic dermatitis. She lives in Massachusetts with both parents and her 4-year-old sister. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a 3-cm, nontender rash on her left upper torso. A photograph of the rash is shown. There are also multiple 5 to 8-mm erythematous papules over the lower legs and forearms. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? : Ceftriaxone",
