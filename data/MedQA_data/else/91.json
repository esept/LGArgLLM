  "claim": "A 35-year-old taxi driver presents to his physician with complaints of itchy, watery eyes and excessive sneezing that have become more severe with the change of the seasons. He has previously taken an over-the-counter medication in the past with moderate relief of his symptoms, but it made him very drowsy. He asks to switch to a medication that will not cause drowsiness that may impair his driving. Which of the following medications would you prescribe for this patient? : Chlorpheniramine",
