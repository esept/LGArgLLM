  "claim": "A 68-year-old woman comes to the physician with increasing fatigue and shortness of breath for 2 weeks. She has only passed very small amounts of urine over the past few days. During this time, she has also noticed that her feet appear unusually puffy for a few hours every morning. Three weeks ago, she had a sore throat that resolved spontaneously after several days without antibiotic therapy. She has a 6-month history of lower back and thoracic pain, for which she takes ibuprofen daily. Her only other medication is a laxative for constipation, which she first experienced 8 months ago. Her sister has systemic lupus erythematosus. Her temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. Examination shows pedal edema and conjunctival pallor. There is tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine and the 8th rib on the right. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 9.8 mg/dL\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 50 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2.8 mg/dL\nCalcium 12.9 mg/dL\nUrine\nProtein negative\nBlood negative\nWhich of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?\" : Immunoglobulin light chains",
