  "claim": "A 41-year-old woman presents with pain in her abdomen for the last couple of hours. She says pain is intermittent and localized to the right hypochondriac region. She admits to eating fatty foods this morning before the pain started. She also complains of nausea but has not vomited yet. She describes episodes with similar symptoms in the past after a fatty meal but were less severe. Past medical history is irrelevant. The vital signs include: heart rate 85/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6\u00b0F), and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination is within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound is pending. Which of the following hormones most likely is the cause of the postprandial aggravation of this patient's symptoms? : Gastrin",
