He says his heart rate has been well-controlled since starting metoprolol and warfarin in the hospital but says he has developed a painful lesion on his left leg. His blood pressure is 114/78 mm Hg, the heart rate is 84/min, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. On physical examination, there is a large, dark lesion on his left leg that feels cold (see image).
