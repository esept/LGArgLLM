  "claim": "A 47-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital because of a 2-week history of low-grade fever, fatigue, and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows pallor and a cardiac murmur. Her serum creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL. Urinalysis shows red cell casts and 2+ protein. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows no abnormalities. Despite appropriate medical therapy, the patient dies. A photograph of the heart taken during autopsy is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the laboratory findings in this patient? : Deposition of antigen-antibody complexes",
