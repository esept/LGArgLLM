  "claim": "A 70-year-old man presents to a physician\u2019s office with shortness of breath for 1 month. He is \u201ceasily winded\u201d and is unable to keep up with his grandchildren when playing in the park. Over the last few weeks, he had to increase the number of pillows under his head to sleep comfortably. He denies a cough and fever. The medical history includes hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. His current medications are aspirin, carvedilol, and rosuvastatin. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, pulse 90/min, and respiratory rate 14/min. The physical examination reveals distended jugular veins, bilateral pitting edema of the lower limbs, and fine crackles at the base of the lungs. An echocardiogram reveals an ejection fraction of 40%. Inhibition of which of the following hormones would be most beneficial for this patient? : Angiotensin II",
