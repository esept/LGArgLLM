Over the past 5 months, she has had a persistent nonproductive cough, excessive fatigue, and a 5.6-kg (12.3-lb) weight loss. She does not smoke. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a 2.0-cm nodule with irregular borders at the upper lobe of the left lung. A CT-guided biopsy of the lung nodule is performed. Pathologic examination of the biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following? : Large cell lung carcinoma",
