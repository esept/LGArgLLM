  "claim": "A 4-year-old boy is referred to the infectious disease clinic for recurrent pneumonia. Although he has had several previous hospital admissions and received multiple courses of antibiotic therapy, he continues to get sick. On his most recent hospital admission, the boy presented with mild fever, right-sided chest pain, and yellow-colored sputum. He had difficulty breathing and diminished breath sounds on the right side of the chest. A CT scan of the thorax revealed multiple right-sided ground-glass opacities. Sputum cultures grew Aspergillus galactomannan. The boy\u2019s medical history is significant for neonatal sepsis and recurrent episodes of pyoderma and otitis media. His younger brother had recurrent purulent skin infections before he died of an otogenic brain abscess at the age of 2. His mother says that skin infections are common in the male members of her family. The patient\u2019s HIV status is negative and his complete blood count, T cell and B cell counts, immunoglobulin profile, and complement tests are within normal limits. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient? : Flow cytometry for CD18+ cell deficiency",
