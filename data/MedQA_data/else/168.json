  "claim": "A 33-year-old G1P0 at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery floor for induction of labor. She feels well and is no acute distress. She is accompanied by her husband. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes sertraline. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. To initiate labor induction, the obstetrician injects the patient with a hormone that is endogenously made in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary. This medication is associated with an increased risk of which of the following complications? : Vasa previa",
