  "claim": "A previously healthy 31-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department after an all-night binge that included smoking, alcohol, and cocaine. He complains of chest fluttering, fatigue, and lightheadedness. His past medical and family history are noncontributory. Social history is positive for occasional smoking and social drinking. At the hospital, the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and the heart rate of 160/min and regular. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown. A physical maneuver involving massage of the neck is attempted without improvement. The patient is given the appropriate medication that improves his heart rate and returns his ECG to normal. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the medication? : Blocking of sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump",
