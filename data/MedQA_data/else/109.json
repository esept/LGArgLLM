Neurologic examination shows areflexia of the ankle and knee joints bilaterally. Motor strength is 1/5 in both lower legs.

Six weeks after admission, deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the ankles, and she is able to wiggle her toes. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the improvement in this patient's neurological status? : Replication of oligodendrocyte precursor cells",
