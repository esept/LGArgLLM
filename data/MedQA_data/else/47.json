  "claim": "A 29-year-old woman presents with low-grade fever, rash, and joint pain. She says her symptoms started gradually about 3 months ago and have progressively worsened. The patient describes her rash as pruritic, flat, and localized to her face. She reports a different type of rash on her shoulders and arms that are aggravated by exposure to sunlight. She describes her joint pain as moderate, dull and aching in character, and present mainly in the small bones of her wrists and hands, worse on the right than the left. She has no other relevant medical history and takes no current medications. Her family history is notable for her maternal grandmother, who had an unknown autoimmune condition. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. Her temperature is 38.0\u2103 (100.3\u2109), pulse is 59/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/84 mm Hg. On physical examination, there is a macular, erythematous rash that involves both cheeks and the bridge of her nose, sparing the nasolabial folds. There is also a mild macular rash on the sun-exposed areas of her upper extremities and shoulders. She has moderate to severe point tenderness in the small joints of her wrists and hands, worse on the right, with minimal erythema and swelling. Multiple painless ulcers are present on the soft and hard palate. Which of the following additional findings would most likely be present in this patient? : Immunologically mediated destruction of the salivary glands",
