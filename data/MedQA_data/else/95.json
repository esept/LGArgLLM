  "claim": "A 28-year-old man presents with episodic abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea for the past week. He says that the abdominal pain is diffusely localized to the periumbilical region and is dull and cramping in character. He also reports episodes of painful, bloody diarrhea up to 7 times per day. A colonoscopy is performed and shows continuous erythema, superficial ulcers, and pseudopolyps in the rectum and sigmoid colon. A biopsy is taken and sent for histological evaluation. One of the slides from the biopsy is shown in the image below.
