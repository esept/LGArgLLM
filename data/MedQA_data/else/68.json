  "claim": "A 36-year-old man presents with a 3-week history of fever, enlarged lymph nodes, fatigue, and a dry cough. The patient\u2019s wife says she has noticed that he lost a lot of weight over the last 6 months and seems very pale. Over the last week, he has noticed a worsening non-productive cough and night sweats. His blood count shows anemia and low lymphocyte count. He tells the physician that he had multiple unprotected sexual relationships with women other than his wife about 6 years ago and is fearful this may be related to his current health concerns. A test is performed which screens for the cause of this patient's immunodeficiency. Which of the following does this screening test detect? : HIV viral load",
