  "claim": "A 64-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his daughter for forgetfulness. The patient\u2019s daughter reports that over the past 2 weeks the patient has become more confused. He did not remember to pick up his car from the body shop last week, and yesterday, he did not show up to his grandson\u2019s birthday party. When she went over to the patient\u2019s house to check on him, she noticed the mailbox was stuffed with unopened letters. The patient says \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just have a headache.\u201d The patient\u2019s daughter adds, \u201cI just hope you\u2019re not drinking again dad. Your neighbor saw you fall outside the house a few weeks ago, and the other day you said you were nauseous and vomited.\u201d The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. He takes aspirin, amlodipine, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and warfarin. He smokes cigars, but denies alcohol use since he started psychotherapy 7 months ago. The patient\u2019s temperature is 97\u00b0F (36.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 144/92 mmHg, and pulse is 82/min. On physical examination, there is a 3 cm ecchymosis on the right scalp. No focal neurological deficits are appreciated. Gait is normal. An initial complete blood count shows normocytic anemia. The patient\u2019s INR is 2.5. Imaging is pending. Which of the following is a treatment option for the patient\u2019s most likely diagnosis? : Burr hole",
