  "claim": "A 35-year-old woman, otherwise healthy, presents with frequent nosebleeds and bruising on her legs. She says that her symptoms started about 6 months ago and have not improved. She remembers that her 8-year-old son had similar symptoms about a month ago following a viral respiratory infection, but his symptoms quickly resolved without treatment. No significant past medical history and no current medications. Family history is significant for her father dying at age 65 of myocardial infarction. Review of systems is significant for her last period 2 weeks ago being a bit heavier than usual. Her vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 100/75 mm Hg, pulse 98/min, respirations 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. Cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. There is non-palpable purpura present on the lower extremities bilaterally. Which of the following set of laboratory results and peripheral blood smear findings would most likely be seen in this patient? : Platelets: Decreased | Bleeding time: Increased | PT: Increased| PTT: Increased | Blood smear: Schistocytes present",
