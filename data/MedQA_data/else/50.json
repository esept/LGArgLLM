  "claim": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of progressive headache, blurry vision, and nausea for 1 day. Four days ago, she was diagnosed with a right middle ear infection. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 148/95 mm Hg. Ophthalmologic examination shows bilateral swelling of the optic disc. The corneal reflex in the right eye is absent. Sensation to touch is reduced on the upper right side of the face. Serum studies show increased concentrations of fibrin degradation products. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? : Hypertensive emergency",
