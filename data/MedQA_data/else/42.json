She had similar symptoms last year and her medical record included the following arterial blood gas findings:\npH 7.51\npO2 77 mm Hg\npCO2  32 mm Hg\nAn ECG last year demonstrated a right axis deviation. The current chest X-ray showed enlarged pulmonary arteries but no parenchymal in\ufb01ltrates. A lung perfusion scan revealed a low probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. The current ECG showed right heart strain but no evidence of primary cardiac disease. What is the most logical diagnostic test for this patient? : Holter monitoring",
