  "claim": "A 44-year-old woman comes to the office because of 4 episodes of loss of consciousness over the past 2 weeks. She recovered immediately and was not confused following the episodes. For the past 6 months, she has also had increased shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest tightness that resolves with rest. She immigrated with her family from India 10 years ago. Pulse is 115/min and irregular and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows an accentuated and split S2. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur in the fifth left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation and right axis deviation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of these findings? : Increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure",
