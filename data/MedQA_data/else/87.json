  "claim": "A group of researchers is conducting a prospective study to examine if dietary fiber intake is protective against coronary heart disease. Specifically, they are looking at the frequency of coronary heart incidents in a group of middle-aged men taking various daily amounts of water-insoluble fiber. The Pearson correlation coefficient that was obtained regarding the relationship between the amount of daily water-insoluble fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents in their study was 0.11 with a p-value of 0.006. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this study result? : There is no correlation between fiber intake and the frequency of coronary heart incidents because the correlation coefficient is significant.",
