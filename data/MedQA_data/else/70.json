  "claim": "A 40-year-old man undergoes an elective cholecystectomy for repeated attacks of cholelithiasis over the last 5 years. In the operating room, rapid sequence intubation is performed using a certain muscle relaxant to prevent aspiration of gastric contents. During the procedure, atracurium is administered to maintain muscle relaxation and, 1.5 hours after the operation, the anesthesiologist administers neostigmine to reverse the paralysis. The patient, however, continues to remain paralyzed and cannot be extubated. Which of the following drugs most likely caused prolonged muscle paralysis in this patient? : Dantrolene",
