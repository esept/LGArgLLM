The bumps are about 0.5 cm in diameter and are filled with a clear fluid. They extend on both arms but are not in her mouth or torso. The lesions do not pop with pressure but remain tense. Her skin does not slough off with rubbing. The patient denies any other symptoms including joint pain or fever. The patient has no other medical history. The patient\u2019s condition is most likely caused by antibodies against which of the following compounds? : Hemidesmosomes",
