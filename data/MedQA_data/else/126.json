  "claim": "A 23-year-old female comes to the office because of a 3-week history of vaginal discharge and itching despite cleaning her genitals with a vaginal douche. Her last menstrual period was one week ago. She is sexually active with her new boyfriend. She has an intrauterine device and does not use barrier protection. She was treated for a sore throat infection one month ago. Speculum examination shows erythema around the vaginal introitus and copious white discharge. Vaginal pH is 4.3 and a KOH test shows multiple pseudohyphae on microscopy. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition? : Increased vaginal pH",
