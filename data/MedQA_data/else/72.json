  "claim": "A 40-year-old man presents with left hip pain. He says that symptoms started a month ago and have progressively worsened. He says the pain has rendered him unable to report to work for the last 2 weeks. The pain was initially 4/10 in intensity, dull with no radiation and was aggravated to 5/10 in intensity upon weight-bearing. Initially, it improved with rest and Tylenol. He initially attributed it to heavy work and took a few days off work, but he did not seek medical attention. However, it worsened over time to its present 8/10 intensity and does not respond to Tylenol anymore. The patient denies any history of injury, weight loss, change in appetite, or recent travel. His past medical history is significant for Crohn's disease, managed with a combination of prednisone and mesalamine and presently in remission. On physical examination, there is limited flexion and extension at the left hip. The rest of the examination, including a complete neurological examination, is unremarkable. On abdominal imaging of the left hip joint, a transcervical fracture is noted in the left hip with surrounding bony sclerosis. A DEXA scan shows a T-score of  -2.5 at the hips and -1.5 at the lumbar spine (normal T-score \u2265 -1.0). Which of the following is most likely to be the underlying cause for the fracture in this patient? : Chronic steroid use",
