He was found on the ground by his daughter earlier today, and he was last known to be without neurological deficits two hours prior to presentation. His temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 185/105 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 18/min. A non-contrast head CT is performed, which demonstrates a hypodense lesion affecting the left medial frontal and parietal lobe.
