  "claim": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of progressively worsening lower back pain and weakness in the lower extremities. The pain is worse with movement and improves with lying down on a flat surface. She was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 6 months ago and is currently taking isoniazid and rifampin. Physical examination shows sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the mid-thigh, patella, and medial aspect of the right lower leg. Strength is 2/5 with right-sided dorsiflexion and the patellar reflex is absent. An x-ray of the spine shows a paravertebral opacity with anterior wedging of the vertebral body. Which of the following nerve roots is most likely to be affected in this patient? : L5",
