  "claim": "A 75-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation for the past 2 days. She has urinated frequently over the past week and has become excessively thirsty during this time. She has no significant past medical history. She is a 30-pack-year smoker. She appears confused. Her blood pressure is 95/70 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 25/min, and temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F). She has dry oral mucosa. Lung auscultation shows rhonchi and wheezing localized to the right middle lobe area. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a shortened QT interval. A computed tomography scan is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s recent condition? : Adenocarcinoma",
