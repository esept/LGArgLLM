  "claim": "A 49-year-old woman presents to her pulmonologist for a follow-up visit. She reports a longstanding history of chronic dyspnea and fatigue. Her past medical history is notable for asthma. She has a known mutation in the BMPR2 gene. She was recently trialed on nifedipine but stopped due to severe lower extremity edema. She does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. Her temperature is 99.4\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/80 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination reveals an increased P2 on cardiac auscultation. Her physician recommends starting a medication to slow the patient\u2019s clinical worsening that requires regular monitoring of liver function tests. This medication has which of the following mechanisms of action? : Beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonist",
