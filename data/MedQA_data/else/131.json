  "claim": "A 60-year-old man presents to the physician for a follow-up examination. During the previous visit, splenomegaly was detected on the abdominal exam, which has been confirmed by abdominal ultrasound. He has no complaints other than fatigue for several months. There is no history of serious illness. His only medication is acetaminophen for knee pain. The temperature is 36.7\u2103 (98.1\u2109), pulse is 68, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, the spleen size on percussion is 16 cm (6.2 in). Otherwise, the physical examination shows no abnormalities. The laboratory test results are as follows:\nHemoglobin 10 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 90 \u03bcm3\nLeukocyte count 80,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 450,000/mm3\nThe peripheral blood smear shows a predominance of neutrophils and the presence of band cells, myelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts (< 5%). The cytogenetic study shows t(9;22). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? : Chronic myeloid leukemia",
