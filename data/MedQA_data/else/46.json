  "claim": "A 62-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of a mass near her right jaw. She reports that the mass is painless and has grown very slowly over the past six months. She initially did not see a physician due to being very busy at her work as a lawyer. However, she reports that she noticed some right-sided facial weakness in the past week which prompted her to visit the physician. Her past medical history is notable for Hodgkins lymphoma as a child which required radiation therapy to the neck. She has a 20 pack-year smoking history and drinks alcohol socially. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a painless firm mass at the angle of the right jaw. There is also a small palpable firm mass beneath the floor of the mouth. A right facial droop along with an inability to elevate her right eyebrow is noted. A biopsy of one of this lesion would most likely reveal which of the following? : Cystic configurations of anaplastic squamous and mucoid cells",
