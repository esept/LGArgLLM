This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation are expected to have an increased muscle relaxation time and an increased cytosolic calcium concentration.",
