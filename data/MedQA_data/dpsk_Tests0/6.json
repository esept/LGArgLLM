  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 36-year-old man undergoes open reduction and internal fixation of a left femur fracture sustained after a motor vehicle collision. Three days after the surgery, he develops fever and redness around the surgical site. His temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F). Physical examination shows purulent discharge from the wound with erythema of the surrounding skin. Wound culture of the purulent discharge shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Treatment with oral dicloxacillin is initiated. Four days later, the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The bacterial adaptation in binding proteins best explains why the patient has failed to improve with antibiotic therapy.",
