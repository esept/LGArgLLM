Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into the inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock.",
