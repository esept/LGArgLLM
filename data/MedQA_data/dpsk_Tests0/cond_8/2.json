Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that CD8+ T lymphocytes are the immune cells described in the claim due to their ability to lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation, particularly in the context of downregulated class I MHC molecules. Each argument's justification reinforces this central idea, ensuring semantic overlap.
