Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic justification related to the anatomical and physiological pathways of metastasis from ovarian cancer to the brain. Each argument either directly supports the described lymphatic route or provides additional context (e.g., transcoelomic spread, hematogenous spread, role of the thoracic duct) that collectively reinforces the plausibility of the claim. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their support for the claim.
