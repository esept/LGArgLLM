Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share semantic intersections in their justifications. For example, the argument stating that "Some non-erythrocyte cells may express bisphosphoglycerate mutase at low levels, and if these cells retain mitochondria, Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase could still be present" contradicts the other arguments that assume the cells lack mitochondria. This lack of overlap in reasoning means not all pairs of arguments share a common justification.
