Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common semantic justification that sodium hypochlorite is effective in inactivating picornaviruses, particularly those that are hepatotropic. Each argument either directly states this or supports it by mentioning the mechanism (denaturing proteins and nucleic acids, disrupting viral capsid integrity), comparing it to less effective alternatives, or discussing its use in specific settings (healthcare, laboratory). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justification related to the claim.
