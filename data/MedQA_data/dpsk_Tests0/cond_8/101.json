Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim that toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most likely explanation for the patient's deterioration in renal function. Each argument either directly references the patient's history of analgesic use, the renal biopsy findings, the absence of other causes, or the clinical presentation, all of which are interconnected and support the same diagnosis. Therefore, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justifications regarding the claim.
