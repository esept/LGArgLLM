Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common idea that a contrast enema is the best next step in management due to the patient's symptoms (delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds) and risk factors (Ashkenazi Jewish descent). Each justification overlaps in emphasizing the diagnostic utility of a contrast enema for conditions like Hirschsprung disease or mechanical obstruction, despite slightly different angles (e.g., clinical presentation, genetic risk, exclusion of other conditions).
