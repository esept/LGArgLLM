Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. Each argument discusses the use of selective alpha-1 agonists for nasal congestion, which is a symptom commonly caused by viral infections. The justifications overlap in their reasoning about the drug's purpose (treating nasal congestion) and the likely cause (viral infection), supporting the claim consistently.
