Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not overlap in their semantic content. Each argument provides a distinct reason why the causative organism is more likely to be HSV rather than CMV, but none of them share a common idea or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the clinical presentation being characteristic of HSV, the second on the rapid onset being classic for HSV-1, and the third on CMV being more associated with systemic symptoms in immunocompromised hosts. Thus, there is no semantic intersection between the justifications of the arguments.
