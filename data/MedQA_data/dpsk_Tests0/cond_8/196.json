Justification: All arguments share the common idea of preserving the amputated finger's viability for potential reattachment. Each justification focuses on a specific aspect of the correct transport method (e.g., maintaining hydration, preventing freezing damage, slowing metabolism, following medical protocols), but all relate to the overarching goal of preserving tissue integrity. The semantic overlap lies in their collective support for the claim's recommended transport procedure.
