Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that an X-ray of the lower extremities is necessary due to the presence of leg deformities and the potential for underlying musculoskeletal disorders. Each argument provides different supporting reasons (family history, clinical examination findings, normal growth percentiles not ruling out deformities, X-ray being non-invasive and definitive, and the importance of early detection), but all ultimately converge on the need for an X-ray as the most appropriate next step in management.
