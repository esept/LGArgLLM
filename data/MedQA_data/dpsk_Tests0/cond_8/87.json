Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that the right coronary artery (RCA) is the most likely site of occlusion given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Each justification emphasizes the RCA's role in supplying blood to the posterior ventricular septum and its association with the described clinical presentation. The semantic overlap is clear as all justifications converge on the RCA's anatomical and pathological relevance to the case.
