Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic justification related to the symptoms and context of marijuana intoxication. Each argument points to specific symptoms (e.g., conjunctival injection, dry mouth, anxiety, tachycardia) or contextual factors (e.g., denial of substance use, celebration setting) that are consistent with marijuana use. These justifications overlap in their support for the claim that marijuana is the most likely intoxication in this patient.
