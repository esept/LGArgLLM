Result: true
Justification: All the arguments provided share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim that the findings are best explained by plague. Each argument points to specific symptoms, geographical exposure, or clinical signs that are characteristic of plague, particularly pneumonic or bubonic plague. The justifications consistently reference the patient's symptoms, the endemic region, and the progression of the disease, all of which support the claim. Therefore, every pair of arguments has at least one common idea or reasoning pattern in their justification that relates to the claim.
