Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument states that standardized questionnaires minimize interviewer bias, the second suggests recall bias is more likely, and the third argues that interviewer bias could occur if interviewers were aware of ASD status. These justifications address different aspects of potential bias without overlapping in meaning.
