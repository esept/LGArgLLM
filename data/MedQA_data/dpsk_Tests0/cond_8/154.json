Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about congestive heart failure (A3) does not overlap with the arguments supporting lymphoma (A1, A2, A5) in terms of justification. Similarly, the argument about other malignancies (A4) introduces a different reasoning pattern (statistical likelihood of other cancers) that does not directly overlap with the justifications for lymphoma. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
