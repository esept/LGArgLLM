Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the necessity of echocardiography to evaluate cardiac structure and function, given the patient's symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, fluid overload) and signs (e.g., elevated JVP, peripheral edema, enlarged cardiac silhouette). The justifications consistently highlight echocardiography's role in diagnosing heart failure, assessing ventricular function, and differentiating between types of dysfunction, all of which are directly relevant to the claim.
