Result: false
Justification: While most arguments share a common theme of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions involving cytotoxic T-cell activity, the third argument introduces a non-immune-mediated reaction (direct toxicity from ceftriaxone) which does not involve cytotoxic T-cell destruction. This creates a semantic divergence as this justification does not overlap with the others' focus on T-cell mediated mechanisms.
