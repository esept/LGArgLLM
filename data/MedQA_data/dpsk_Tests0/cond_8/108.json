Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to the patient's symptoms (heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic heaviness, dyspareunia, increased urinary frequency) and history (multiparity) as evidence supporting the likelihood of a globular 10-week sized uterus due to uterine fibroids. The justifications consistently reference the same underlying medical reasoning and clinical findings.
