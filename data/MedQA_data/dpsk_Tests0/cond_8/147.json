Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with tuberculosis (TB), which is characterized by granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and Langhans cells. Each argument provides different pieces of evidence (symptoms, radiograph findings, lab results, occupational risk) that collectively support the same underlying reasoning pattern linking the clinical presentation to TB and its histological features.
