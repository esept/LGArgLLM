Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. Instead, they all contradict the claim by providing alternative explanations for lower limb swelling in cirrhotic patients (e.g., portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, sodium retention, hemodynamic changes) and explicitly state that hyperestrinism is not the cause. Therefore, there is no semantic overlap in the justifications that supports the claim.
