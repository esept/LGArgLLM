Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument highlights the patient's symptoms (facial flushing, weakness, chronic diarrhea, and hypercalcemia) as classic features of VIPoma, while the second argument also mentions these symptoms (hypokalemia and hypercalcemia) as consistent with VIPoma. Both justifications focus on the same clinical features supporting the diagnosis of VIPoma.
