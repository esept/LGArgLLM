Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. Each argument presents a distinct reason why the claim about lymphocyte dysfunction is incorrect, focusing on different aspects such as the types of infections, the NBT test's diagnostic use, the range of infections in lymphocyte disorders, and the distinction between innate and adaptive immunity. There is no common idea or proposition shared across all pairs of arguments.
