Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic justification related to impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations as the most likely explanation for the patient's condition. Each argument provides different supporting evidence (e.g., prior meningitis, MRI findings, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, post-infectious scarring, and absence of active infection) that collectively point to the same underlying mechanism. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their support for the claim.
