Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common semantic justification that clozapine requires monitoring of complete blood counts due to its potential side effects, particularly agranulocytosis, and the need for adherence to clinical guidelines for patient safety. Each argument reinforces this central idea, either by mentioning the risk of agranulocytosis, the importance of monitoring, or the patient's specific context (recent start of clozapine and treatment-resistant schizophrenia). Thus, all pairs of arguments overlap in their semantic justifications.
