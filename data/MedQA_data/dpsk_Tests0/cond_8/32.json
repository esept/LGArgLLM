Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that chlorhexidine's mechanism of action is pH-dependent and is reduced in the presence of organic matter. Each argument elaborates on this by describing how chlorhexidine interacts with microbial cell membranes or walls, and how pH and organic matter affect this interaction. Thus, all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
