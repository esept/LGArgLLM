Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that aspirin can negatively affect patients with gastritis. The first argument states that gastritis is a contraindication to aspirin use, while the second argument provides specific reasons (increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and irritant effects on the stomach lining) that support this contraindication. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
