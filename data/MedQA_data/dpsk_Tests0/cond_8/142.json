Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. Each argument provides distinct reasons why the claim is incorrect (e.g., targeting hemidesmosomes instead of gap junctions, immunofluorescence patterns, and the composition of gap junctions). There is no common idea or proposition shared between the justifications that supports the claim.
