  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 14-year-old girl presents with sudden drooping of the right side of her face with drooling and excessive tearing. The patient\u2019s mother says that the patient was recently in northern Maine and spent most of her time during the trip outdoors. Physical examination reveals a slight asymmetry of the facial muscles with an inability to whistle or close the right eye. A circular red rash with central clearing is present on the trunk. There is also decreased taste sensation.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Ixodes scapularis is the most likely transmitter of the organism responsible for this patient\"s illness.",
