  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne\"s muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto\"s thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 13.7 g/dL Leukocytes 11,200/mm3 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h Serum Creatine kinase 212 U/L Lactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L AST 34 U/L ALT 35 U/L.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy is the most likely finding to confirm the diagnosis.",
