  "claim": "Consider the following background information: An 89-year-old woman sees her neurologist for a follow-up evaluation. Three months ago, she presented with complaints about facial asymmetry. Her daughter has noticed that her mother\u2019s mouth is droops downwards on the right side of her face and that she cannot close her right eye well. The same side also lacks wrinkles on the forehead. Since then, the patient feels like her facial muscles have gotten weaker. She was given a course of corticosteroids, but she has still not recovered fully. Upon being asked to close her eyes, the patient has difficulty doing so and fails to completely close her eyelids. On examination, there is no loss of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the whole face. The neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. The neurologist recommends a therapy that will help relieve her symptoms.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient is Botox.",
