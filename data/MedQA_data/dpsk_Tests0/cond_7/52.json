Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the neurological findings (e.g., spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) and their connection to rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the musculoskeletal findings (e.g., symmetric swelling and deformities of the hands). These overlapping themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
