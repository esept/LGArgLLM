Result: false
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. They all link the patient's symptoms (macrocytic anemia, hypersegmented neutrophils, neurological deficits) to vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia, which in turn leads to gastric atrophy, including G cell atrophy. Since none of the pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint, the result is false.
