Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides distinct reasons why the presentation is more consistent with HSV rather than CMV, without overlapping in their semantic content. For example, one focuses on the clinical presentation being characteristic of HSV, another on the rapid onset being classic for HSV-1, and the third on CMV's association with systemic symptoms in different contexts. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps with each other in supporting the claim.
