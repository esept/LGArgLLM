Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the claim by providing overlapping reasons supporting arterial thrombosis as the cause of the patient's condition. For example, multiple arguments mention the sudden onset of symptoms, hypertension, and irregular pulse as factors pointing to arterial thrombosis. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
