Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on obesity as a risk factor for osteoarthritis, the second on the lack of typical RA features, and the third on mechanical joint damage signs. Each addresses a distinct aspect of the patient's condition without overlapping in meaning.
