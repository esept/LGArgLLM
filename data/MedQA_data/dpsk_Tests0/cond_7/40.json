Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the presence of a systolic ejection murmur, such as pre-existing valvular condition, aortic dissection, Marfan syndrome, absence of infective endocarditis, and hemodynamic instability. These reasons do not overlap in meaning and each contributes independently to the claim.
