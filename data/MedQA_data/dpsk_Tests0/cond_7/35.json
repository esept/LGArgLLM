Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim: the first focuses on the nature of the injury (soft tissue or mild sprain), the second on the absence of severe symptoms, the third on the patient's medical history complicating invasive interventions, and the fourth on the patient's response to initial treatment. None of these justifications overlap in their semantic contribution to the claim.
