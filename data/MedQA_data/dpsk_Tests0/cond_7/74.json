Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the adnexal mass and symptoms suggesting gynecologic malignancy, the second argument attributes the symptoms to known conditions (Hashimoto's thyroiditis and GERD), and the third argument highlights risk factors (early menarche and late menopause) for endometrial pathology. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim about the proliferation of endometrial glands.
