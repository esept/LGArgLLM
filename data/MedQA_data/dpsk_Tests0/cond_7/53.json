```
Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the connection between Lyme disease and Ixodes scapularis ticks, the patient's symptoms (e.g., circular red rash, facial drooping), and the geographic relevance (northern Maine). These overlapping elements mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
