Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument's justification focuses on distinct developmental milestones or behaviors of the children at different ages (1 month, 4 months, and 9 months), and there is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim. For example, the justification for the first child's age (1 month) discusses feeding and elimination patterns, while the justification for the second child's age (4 months) discusses social behavior and motor skills, and the justification for the third child's age (9 months) discusses exploratory behavior and motor skills. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset.
