Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments relate to the patient's likely condition of heart failure and its physiological consequences (elevated BNP, elevated ADH, and low sodium). They share a common semantic subset (heart failure and its effects) that contributes to supporting the claim. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are entirely disjoint with respect to the claim.
