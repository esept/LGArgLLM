Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing overlapping evidence and reasoning that supports spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) as the cause of the patient's symptoms, which involves anterior horn cell degeneration. For example, multiple arguments mention the symmetric flaccid weakness and diminished reflexes, which are key features of SMA. Thus, there is a common semantic subset in the justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
