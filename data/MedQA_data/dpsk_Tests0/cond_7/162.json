Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim that echocardiography is the most appropriate next step. They all relate to the patient's symptoms and signs suggesting cardiac pathology, and how echocardiography is the best tool to evaluate such conditions. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to the same line of reasoning supporting the claim.
