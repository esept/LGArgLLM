Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments focus on differentiating the symptoms and presentation of the patient from a bacterial lymphatic infection, suggesting a viral infection (herpes zoster) instead. They share a common semantic theme of contrasting the patient's symptoms with typical bacterial infection features, thus overlapping in their support against the claim.
