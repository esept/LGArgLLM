Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the claim that a gluten-free diet would have prevented the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms by linking the symptoms to celiac disease, which is treated with a gluten-free diet. Since all justifications overlap in their support of the claim through the diagnosis of celiac disease, none of the pairs are semantically disjoint.
