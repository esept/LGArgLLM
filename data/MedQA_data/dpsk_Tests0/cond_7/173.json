Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the necessity of an X-ray for diagnosing potential musculoskeletal disorders in the child. They overlap in their focus on clinical findings (leg deformities, family history of DDH, examination findings), the limitations of physical examination alone, and the benefits of early detection via X-ray. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
