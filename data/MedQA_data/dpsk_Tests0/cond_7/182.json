Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss how Drug X activates CDK4, which phosphorylates the Rb protein and affects the G1/S checkpoint, indirectly influencing the G2 phase. Similarly, the fourth argument also mentions the G1/S checkpoint and the potential accumulation of cells in the G2 phase. These overlapping themes mean the justifications share common semantic subsets related to the claim.
