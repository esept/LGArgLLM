Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three justifications relate to the claim by explaining why the sequence described in the scenario does not undergo VDJ recombination. They share a common semantic theme of distinguishing the sequence's behavior from the VDJ recombination process, albeit from slightly different angles (specificity of VDJ recombination, pattern recognition mechanism, and cell types involved).
