Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Some arguments focus on the protein-level regulation of HIF-1a (e.g., post-translational modifications and degradation), while others discuss mRNA-level changes (e.g., transcriptional upregulation or mRNA stabilization). These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they address different aspects of HIF-1a regulation (protein vs. mRNA). Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
