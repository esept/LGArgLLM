Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both mention the absence of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase due to the cells' focus on glycolysis and lack of mitochondria, which are related points. Similarly, the first and sixth arguments both highlight the lack of mitochondria in erythrocytes as a reason for the absence of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. However, there are also arguments (like the third and fifth) that consider the possibility of the enzyme's presence in non-erythrocyte cells, which introduces a disjoint perspective. Therefore, since at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications, the result is true.
