Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the need for a contrast enema based on the patient's symptoms, risk factors, and clinical presentation. They overlap in their support for the claim by addressing the diagnostic utility of a contrast enema in cases of delayed meconium passage and abdominal distension, as well as the relevance of the patient's Ashkenazi Jewish descent and clinical findings. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
