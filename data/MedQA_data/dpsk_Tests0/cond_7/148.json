Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all focus on the same core idea: that the patient's condition suggests an active infection requiring immediate treatment rather than further diagnostic imaging like bone scintigraphy. They overlap in emphasizing the urgency of treatment over additional diagnostics, given the confirmed diagnosis and signs of infection. Thus, none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
