Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument presents a distinct reason or alternative approach (e.g., uterine artery ligation, uterine artery embolization, hysterectomy, uterotonics) for managing the patient's condition, without overlapping in their supporting propositions. For example, one argument focuses on the failure of conservative measures, another on hemodynamic instability, and another on the presence of a red mass, each providing a separate rationale for the next step in management.
