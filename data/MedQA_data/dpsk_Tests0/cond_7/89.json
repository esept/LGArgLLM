Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic subset: they all argue against reducing the daily insulin dose by pointing out that the patient's symptoms and high morning glucose are due to nocturnal hypoglycemia (Somogyi effect) and insufficient overnight insulin action. Thus, their justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
