Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or perspective on why the patient might show a scaphoid abdomen, with no overlap in their supporting propositions. For example, one argument focuses on Tetralogy of Fallot, another on general cardiac etiology, another on diaphragmatic hernia, and the last on right-to-left shunt. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
