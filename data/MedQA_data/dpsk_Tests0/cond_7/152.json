Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments overlap in their focus on the patient's condition (panic disorder) and the inadequacy of lorazepam for long-term management. Both arguments implicitly or explicitly suggest that lorazepam is not the best choice, with one advocating for SSRIs/SNRIs and the other emphasizing the need for therapy. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
