Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset in their justifications, which is that the patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with an acute ischemic stroke, and the priority is to confirm the diagnosis and assess for appropriate therapy (e.g., thrombolytic or endovascular therapy) rather than performing a lumbar puncture. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
