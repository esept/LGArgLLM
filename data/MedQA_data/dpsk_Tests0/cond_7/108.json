Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim that a globular 10-week sized uterus is likely present in the patient. They all reference symptoms and conditions (e.g., heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic heaviness, multiparity, dyspareunia, urinary frequency) that are consistent with uterine fibroids and an enlarged uterus, which are central to the claim. Thus, no pair of justifications is disjoint with respect to the claim.
