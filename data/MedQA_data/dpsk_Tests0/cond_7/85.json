Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the need for a CT angiogram in the context of the patient's symptoms, medical history, and risk factors. They overlap semantically in supporting the claim that a CT angiogram is the best next step in management. For example, multiple arguments mention the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension as reasons for the CT angiogram, indicating shared semantic content. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
