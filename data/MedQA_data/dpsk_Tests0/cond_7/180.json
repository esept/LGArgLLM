Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the same semantic subset: the use of selective alpha-1 agonists for nasal congestion caused by viral infections. They overlap in meaning by discussing the vasoconstrictive effects of the drug, the commonality of nasal congestion in viral infections, and the alignment of the prescription with viral causes. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
