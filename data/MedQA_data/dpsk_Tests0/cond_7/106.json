Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument links gastric varices and portal hypertension to portal vein thrombosis, while the second argument attributes the patient's condition (elevated ammonia and altered mental status) to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of cirrhosis. These justifications address different aspects of the patient's condition and do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
