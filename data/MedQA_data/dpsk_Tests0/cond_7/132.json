Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications discuss the use of laparoscopy in the context of undescended testicles, with one focusing on guidelines for palpable cases and the other on non-palpable cases. They share a common semantic subset related to the management of undescended testicles.
