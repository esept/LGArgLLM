Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or perspective (e.g., off-label use, symptom improvement, atypical prescription, adjunct therapy) that does not overlap in meaning with the others when supporting the claim about the drug being prescribed for bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma.
