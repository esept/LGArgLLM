Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim about joint effusion and pannus on ultrasound, without overlapping in meaning. For example, one argument focuses on symptoms, another on risk factors, another on age and pain pattern, and the last on the absence of inflammatory markers. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
