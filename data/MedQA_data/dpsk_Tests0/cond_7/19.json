Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the properties and effectiveness of phenol as a disinfectant, specifically its ability to oxidize and denature proteins, its common use in laboratory settings, and its effectiveness against Clostridium perfringens. These justifications overlap in their support for the claim that phenol was likely used as the disinfectant, and none of them are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
