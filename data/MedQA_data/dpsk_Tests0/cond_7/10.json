Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the patient's age and potential exposure risk, while the second justification emphasizes the reduced urgency due to the patient being older than the typical recommended age group. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
