Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the timing of symptoms post-vaccination, the second on the absence of redness or swelling, and the third on the specific gait abnormality (Trendelenburg gait). Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
