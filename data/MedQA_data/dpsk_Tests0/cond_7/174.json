Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all revolve around the same core idea: that vitamin A deficiency can cause both the bladder findings (squamous metaplasia) and photodermatitis, and that the patient's history (Crohn disease, infliximab use) supports this possibility. The arguments overlap in their support for the claim by referencing the same underlying mechanisms and clinical associations.
