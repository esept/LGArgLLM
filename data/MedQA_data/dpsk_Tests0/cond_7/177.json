Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their discussion of carbamazepine's effects during pregnancy, particularly its association with teeth discoloration in children. For example, multiple arguments mention carbamazepine's known risks (e.g., dental discoloration, enamel hypoplasia) and its impact on fetal development. Since these justifications share common semantic elements related to the claim, none of the pairs are fully disjoint.
