Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, multiple arguments reference the patient's symptoms of left calf pain when walking (intermittent claudication) and how cilostazol is an appropriate treatment for this condition. Additionally, several arguments mention the patient's risk factors (diabetes, smoking, coronary artery disease) and how they support the use of cilostazol. These overlapping themes mean the justifications share common semantic subsets that contribute to supporting the claim.
