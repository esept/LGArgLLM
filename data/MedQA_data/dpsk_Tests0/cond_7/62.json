Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset in their justifications, which is that lower limb swelling in cirrhotic patients is not caused by hyperestrinism but by other factors (e.g., portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, sodium retention, hemodynamic changes). Since none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false.
