Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the necessity of calcium ion efflux for myocyte relaxation. Each justification discusses the role of calcium ion efflux in terminating contraction and enabling relaxation, albeit with slightly different emphases (e.g., sarcomere disengagement, actin-myosin interaction termination, calcium reuptake, troponin deactivation). Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
