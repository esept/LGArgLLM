  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of irregular menstrual bleeding. Menses have occurred at 30- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband and they do not use condoms. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 73 kg (161 lb); BMI is 25.3 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe acne on the face. There is dark hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. Laboratory studies show: Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 6.2 \u03bcg/mL (N=0.5\u20135.4) Follicle-stimulating hormone 20 mIU/mL Luteinizing hormone 160 mIU/mL Testosterone 4.1 nmol/L (N < 3.5) A urine pregnancy test is negative.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: CA-125 level measurement is the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient.",
