  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 31-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of acute onset neck pain and enlargement. Specifically, he reports that he has been experiencing pain and swelling of the anterior portion of his neck near the midline. Otherwise, he says that he has been getting tired easily and feels cold often. Physical exam reveals a painful diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with many small nodules. A biopsy is obtained showing diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia. Given these findings, the patient is started on appropriate therapy, and the neck mass becomes smaller over time.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Iodine deficiency is most likely associated with the cause of this patient\"s symptoms.",
