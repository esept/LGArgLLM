  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 3-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for delayed passage of meconium. His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient\u2019s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient\u2019s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient\u2019s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The best next step in management is to perform a contrast enema.",
