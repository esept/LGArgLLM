The patient denies having any history of asthma or respiratory symptoms, and does not smoke. His temperature is 99.8\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C), pulse is 65/min, blood pressure is 126/86 mmHg, and respirations are 20/min. His oxygen saturation is 97%. On exam, he is pale and diaphoretic. His pupils are contracted. Diffuse wheezes are noted in all lung fields.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Atropine and pralidoxime are the best treatment for his condition.",
