  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 67-year-old male comes into the ED complaining of dyspnea and a heavy feeling in his chest. He reports that over the past month he has become more easily \u201cwinded\" to the point that he now sleeps in his living room because he can\u2019t make it up the stairs. A review of systems is notable for headaches and fatigue. On physical exam you note decreased breath sounds and a dullness to percussion on the right. A chest radiograph is obtained, which shows a right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis is performed and the fluid is analyzed, with results shown below:  Volume: 30 cc of fluid Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Lymphoma  may have led to the findings in this patient\u2019s pleural cavity.",
