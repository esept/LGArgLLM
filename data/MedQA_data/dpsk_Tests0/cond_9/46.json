Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that TNF-alpha is a factor secreted by Th1 cells and is responsible for the described actions (macrophage activation, phagosome-lysosome fusion, NO production, and tubercle formation). Each justification reinforces this central idea with specific details, confirming a consistent and overlapping support for the claim.
