Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not all support the same semantic core. While most arguments support the idea that the rash is due to cytotoxic T-cell destruction of antigen-tagged cells as part of a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction, one argument (the third one) suggests the rash could be due to a non-immune-mediated reaction, which does not involve cytotoxic T-cell activity. This creates a lack of a common intersection across all justifications.
