Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Some arguments focus on the post-translational regulation of HIF-1a (protein level), while others discuss the possibility of mRNA-level changes (transcriptional upregulation). There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim uniformly.
