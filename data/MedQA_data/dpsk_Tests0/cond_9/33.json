Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They all emphasize that a sputum culture is clinically indicated due to the patient's persistent cough and hemoptysis, can identify bacterial pathogens, is a standard diagnostic tool, and aligns with standard clinical practice. The overlap in meaning across all justifications confirms a shared basis for the claim.
