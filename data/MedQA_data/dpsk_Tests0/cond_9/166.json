Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core centered around the patient's symptoms (flushing, diarrhea, palpitations) and elevated urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, which collectively point to carcinoid syndrome caused by a serotonin-secreting tumor, most likely located in the adrenal medulla. The justifications consistently support the claim that further evaluation will reveal an adrenal medullary mass.
