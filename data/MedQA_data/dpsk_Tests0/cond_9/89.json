Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they all argue against the claim by suggesting that reducing the daily insulin dose would worsen the patient's condition (e.g., exacerbating the Somogyi effect, impairing glycemic control, or being contraindicated). There is no intersection of justifications that supports the claim.
