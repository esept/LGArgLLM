Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that the patient's symptoms (fatigue, weakness, weight loss, hypotension, hyperpigmentation) are classic for primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and require immediate treatment with both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Each justification reinforces this diagnosis and the necessity of the proposed therapy, making the support for the claim consistent and unified.
