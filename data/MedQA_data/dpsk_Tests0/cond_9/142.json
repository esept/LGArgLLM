Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of all P-type arguments consistently state that the antibodies in bullous pemphigoid target hemidesmosomes (specifically BP180/BP230), not gap junctions. There is no semantic intersection supporting the claim that the antibodies bind to gap junctions; instead, all arguments refute the claim with a shared counterpoint.
