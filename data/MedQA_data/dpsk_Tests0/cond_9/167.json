Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently highlight the role of the spleen's white pulp (zone 3) in immune responses against encapsulated bacteria, its dysfunction leading to increased susceptibility to infections, and the clinical relevance in sickle-cell disease. This shared focus on the white pulp's immune function and its impairment forms a coherent basis for the claim.
