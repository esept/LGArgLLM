Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core, which is the need for sodium bicarbonate as a treatment for tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) toxicity, specifically addressing the patient's symptoms (e.g., widened QRS complex, hemodynamic instability) and the pharmacological action of sodium bicarbonate in such cases. Each justification supports this core idea, making them collectively consistent in supporting the claim.
