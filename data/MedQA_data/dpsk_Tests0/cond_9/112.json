Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument states that the patient's symptoms are more consistent with HIV-related complications, while the second argument highlights the lack of evidence for predisposing factors for megaloblastic anemia. These justifications address different aspects and do not intersect in supporting the claim about the risk of megaloblastic anemia from the medication change.
