Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification points to tuberculosis (TB) as the underlying condition, characterized by granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and Langhans cells. The arguments collectively reference the patient's symptoms, radiographic findings, laboratory results, and occupational risk, all converging on TB as the cause of the described granuloma. This consistent focus on TB and its histological features establishes a shared semantic basis for the claim.
