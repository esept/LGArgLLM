Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments discuss the lymphatic route (e.g., anatomical plausibility, thoracic duct drainage), others mention hematogenous spread or transcoelomic spread, which are different mechanisms. There is no single shared semantic basis across all justifications.
