Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two P-type arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument points to pancreatic fluid leakage due to the patient's history of acute pancreatitis and current abdominal symptoms, while the second argument suggests liver cirrhosis as the primary cause due to the patient's hepatitis C infection and related findings. These are distinct and unrelated explanations for the ascites.
