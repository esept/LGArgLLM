Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share the same semantic core, which is that aspirin can worsen gastritis due to its gastrointestinal effects. The first argument mentions the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the second argument highlights the irritant effects on the stomach lining. Both justifications support the claim that gastritis is a contraindication to aspirin use in this patient.
