Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently highlight classic symptoms (jaundice, normocytic anemia, bone pain), laboratory findings (hemolysis, peripheral blood smear results), demographic alignment (African American), and the absence of contradictory symptoms, all of which are indicative of sickle cell disease. There is no contradiction or divergence in the semantic support provided by the justifications.
