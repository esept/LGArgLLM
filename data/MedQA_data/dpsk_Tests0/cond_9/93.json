Result: true  
Justification: All justifications consistently support the claim by linking the patient's symptoms (holosystolic murmur, feeding difficulties, listlessness) to a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is highly associated with 22q11 deletion syndrome. They also address potential counterpoints (e.g., absence of cyanosis, normal APGAR score, lack of maternal medical history) by explaining why these do not rule out the diagnosis. The semantic core across all justifications is the association between the clinical presentation and 22q11 deletion syndrome via VSD.
