Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations as the most likely explanation for the patient's condition. Each justification supports this claim by linking specific symptoms, history, or MRI findings to impaired CSF flow, often mentioning post-infectious scarring or communicating hydrocephalus as underlying mechanisms.
