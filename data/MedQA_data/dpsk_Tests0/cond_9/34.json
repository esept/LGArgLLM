Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that links decreased adiposity to hypoestrogenemia through mechanisms such as reduced estrogen production in adipose tissue, clinical consistency with conditions like functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and the patient's symptoms (amenorrhea) aligning with low estrogen levels due to low body fat. Each argument supports the claim by reinforcing this shared biological and clinical relationship.
