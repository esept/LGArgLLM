Result: true  
Justification: All justifications point to obesity as the primary factor causing the patient's symptoms. The first justification links obesity to osteoarthritis, which explains the knee pain and crepitus. The second justification dismisses rheumatoid arthritis as the cause, reinforcing the focus on obesity. The third justification further supports obesity-related osteoarthritis by describing the patient's symptoms as classic signs of mechanical joint damage. Thus, there is a common semantic core (obesity as the underlying cause) across all justifications.
