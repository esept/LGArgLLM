Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of all P-type arguments consistently highlight the risks posed by elevated phenylalanine levels to a future pregnancy, directly contradicting the claim that her current levels do not pose a risk. There is no shared semantic core supporting the claim; instead, all arguments oppose it by emphasizing the dangers of high phenylalanine levels during pregnancy.
