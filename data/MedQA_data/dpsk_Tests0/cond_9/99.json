Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification points to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings being classic for osteoarthritis, a condition that typically does not require further diagnostic work-up when the presentation is straightforward. The arguments collectively emphasize the absence of red flags, the chronicity and nature of symptoms, and adherence to clinical guidelines, all converging on the conclusion that no further work-up is needed.
