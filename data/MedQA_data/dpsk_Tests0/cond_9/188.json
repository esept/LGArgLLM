Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments (e.g., classic signs of acute dystonia, timeline of symptoms, haloperidol's side effects) support the claim, others (e.g., symptoms could be tardive dyskinesia, less severe symptoms suggesting a less acute condition, likelihood of other movement disorders) contradict or weaken the claim. There is no intersection of meaning across all justifications that uniformly supports the claim.
