Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification argues against exploratory laparoscopy for palpable undescended testicles, recommending orchiopexy instead. The second justification suggests laparoscopy only if imaging indicates an intra-abdominal testicle. These justifications do not collectively support the claim that exploratory laparoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management.
