Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While most arguments support the likelihood of albuminocytologic dissociation due to multiple sclerosis (MS), one argument contradicts this by suggesting spinal cord involvement could lead to elevated white blood cells, and another mentions other conditions that may not show albuminocytologic dissociation. These contradictions prevent a unified semantic basis for the claim.
