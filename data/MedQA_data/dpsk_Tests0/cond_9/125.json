Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core centered around the patient's cirrhosis, altered mental status (hepatic encephalopathy), and the need for empirical antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone due to the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or other infections. Each justification supports the claim by highlighting different aspects of the patient's condition and the appropriateness of ceftriaxone in this context.
