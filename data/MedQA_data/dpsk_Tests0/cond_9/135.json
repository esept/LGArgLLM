Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim about defective lysine synthesis. Instead, both arguments suggest a nutritional deficiency (e.g., vitamin C) as the likely cause of the patient's symptoms, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, there is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim.
