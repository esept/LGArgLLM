Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by pointing out inconsistencies with a bacterial lymphatic infection and suggesting a viral etiology (herpes zoster) as more likely. Therefore, there is no intersection of justifications that supports the claim.
