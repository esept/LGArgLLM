Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core that uniformly supports uterine artery ligation as the best next step in management. While some arguments support uterine artery ligation due to failed conservative measures and hemodynamic instability, others suggest alternatives like uterine artery embolization, hysterectomy, or prioritization of uterotonics. The lack of a consistent semantic intersection across all arguments means there is no shared basis for the claim.
