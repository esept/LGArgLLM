Result: true  
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic core that links the patient's symptoms (dyspnea, orthopnea) and history (previous heart attack) to the need for angiography to assess or confirm coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease. Each justification emphasizes the diagnostic utility of angiography in this context, supporting the claim collectively.
