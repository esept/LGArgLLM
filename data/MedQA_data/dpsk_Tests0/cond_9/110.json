Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification relates to the impaired function of the SERCA1 calcium ATPase pump due to ATP2A1 mutations, leading to prolonged muscle relaxation times and increased cytosolic calcium concentration. The justifications collectively reinforce this mechanism through physiological, clinical, and biochemical evidence, aligning with the claim's expectations.
