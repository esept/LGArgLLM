Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim for an X-ray of the lower extremities. They collectively emphasize the necessity of an X-ray due to the presence of leg deformities, family history of developmental dysplasia of the hip, clinical examination findings suggesting structural abnormalities, and the importance of early detection to prevent long-term complications. Each justification reinforces the idea that an X-ray is the most appropriate diagnostic tool in this scenario.
