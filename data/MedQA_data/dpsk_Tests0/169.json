  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show: Hemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL Hematocrit 43.2 % White blood cells 14,500 /mm3 Platelets 312,000/mm3 Neutrophil 81.6% Lymphocyte 15.2% Monocyte 1.4% Eosinophil 1.2% Basophil 0.6% Serum Na+ 138 mEq/L K+ 4.3 mEq/L Cl- 108 mmol/L BUN 12 mg/dL Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient is Amoxicillin.",
