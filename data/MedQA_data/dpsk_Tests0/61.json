  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 51-year-old man presents the emergency room with chest pain. He mentions that the pain started several hours ago and radiates to his left neck and shoulder. He also mentions that he has some difficulty in breathing. He says that he has had similar chest pains before, but nothing seemed to be wrong at that time. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol during that episode and was prescribed medication. He also has a 3-year history of gastritis. The blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, respirations are 18/min, and the pulse is 110/min. He seems a little anxious. The physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. An ECG shows slight changes in the leads. His physician talks to him about the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin daily.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Gastritis is a contraindication to the use of aspirin in this patient.",
