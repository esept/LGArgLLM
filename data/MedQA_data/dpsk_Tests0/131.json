  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 70-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of back pain. For the past six days, she has had a burning pain in her upper right back and chest. She cannot recall any recent injury and has no prior history of back pain. She has a history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux. The patient volunteers at an animal shelter three times a week. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include ramipril and pantoprazole. The patient appears healthy and well nourished. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.42\u00b0F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. Examination shows a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions extending from her back to below her right breast.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely underlying mechanism of the disease is a bacterial lymphatic infection of the epidermis.",
