  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient\"s dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient\"s vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: This patient\"s history is most likely to include a diagnosis of gum disease and poor wound healing.",
