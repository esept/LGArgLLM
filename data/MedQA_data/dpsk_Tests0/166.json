  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and a weight loss of 4 kg (8.8 lb) over the last 4 months. She has recently avoided drinking alcohol and eating spicy food because it worsens her diarrhea and causes episodes of heart palpitations and reddening of the face and neck. She takes lisinopril for hypertension. Her temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 149/90 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft, and there is mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show an increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Further evaluation of this patient will most likely show an adrenal medullary mass.",
