Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on the lack of evidence or endorsement for quartz as a treatment in both Internal Medicine and Homeopathy, but none of their justifications fully encompass the minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments. Specifically, the S-type arguments mention that quartz is not commonly used in homeopathy and the lack of peer-reviewed research, which are not fully captured or implied by the P-type justifications. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
