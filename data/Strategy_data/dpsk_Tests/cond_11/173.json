Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument provides a justification that describes how the mongoose's fur coloration or pattern matches the desert environment, which directly supports the claim about natural camouflage. The S-type arguments do not contradict the claim but rather provide additional context, which does not affect the semantic support provided by the P-type arguments. Thus, the claim is supported by the P-type arguments.
