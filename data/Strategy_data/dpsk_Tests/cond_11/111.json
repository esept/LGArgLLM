Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications based on Wilde's adaptability, familiarity with technology, and cosmopolitan lifestyle, but none of these justifications contain the minimal semantic support sets provided by the S-type arguments (lack of availability, no documented evidence, and lack of specialized training). Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
