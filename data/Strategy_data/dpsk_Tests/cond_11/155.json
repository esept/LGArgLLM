Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide general justifications about Nigella Lawson's emphasis on texture, consistency, and the science of cooking, which indirectly relate to solubility. However, none of the S-type arguments (which provide fragments of minimal semantic support) are semantic subsets of the P-type justifications. The S-type arguments either state the absence of direct evidence or focus on Lawson's broader culinary priorities, which do not align with or support the claim about her caring about solubility. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
