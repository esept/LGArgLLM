Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide reasons why Cheb Mami might not win a Pulitzer Prize, focusing on misalignment with the prize's requirements and historical trends. However, none of the P-type arguments' justifications contain the minimal semantic support sets provided by the S-type arguments, which directly address the genre and criteria misalignment. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
