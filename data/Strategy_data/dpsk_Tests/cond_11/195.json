Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not fully cover all minimal semantic bases of the claim. Specifically, the claim states that Super Mario mainly focuses on a man in green, but the P-type arguments either argue against this (focus on Mario in red) or only partially support it (mentioning Luigi in green in certain titles). The S-type arguments provide additional support for Luigi's prominence, but these are not fully captured or supported by the P-type arguments' justifications. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
