Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that are not fully supported by the S-type arguments. The S-type arguments focus on the lack of organized French involvement and the domestic nature of the conflict, which do not directly support the claim that French people were involved. There is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of any P-type argument's justification that directly supports the claim. Additionally, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments' justifications.
