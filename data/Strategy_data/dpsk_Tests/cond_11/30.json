Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on the possibility of Latinos having diverse physical traits (e.g., blonde hair, green eyes) or being perceived as Latino based on cultural contributions, but none of their justifications fully encompass the minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments. The S-type arguments emphasize cultural/ethnic heritage, self-identification, familial ties, and public documentation, which are not addressed as necessary conditions in the P-type justifications. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
