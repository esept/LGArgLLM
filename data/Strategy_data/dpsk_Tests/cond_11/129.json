Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments suggest scenarios where vegans might eat a modified version of paella, but none of their justifications contain the minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, which state that traditional paella includes non-vegan ingredients and that veganism strictly avoids all animal products. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
