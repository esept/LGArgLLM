Result: false  
Justification: The claim states that grief is always obvious when experienced, but the support arguments (S-type) provide counterexamples where grief is not obvious (e.g., masked grief, internal manifestations, private processing). These S-type arguments are not semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications, which only describe scenarios where grief is obvious. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied because not all minimal semantic bases of the claim (including cases where grief is not obvious) are covered by the P-type arguments.
