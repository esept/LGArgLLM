Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide general reasons why French Toast cannot kill a Lannister (e.g., fictional vs. real-world interaction, laws of physics). However, none of the P-type justifications fully contain the specific semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments (e.g., French Toast's lack of agency or mechanism to harm). Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
