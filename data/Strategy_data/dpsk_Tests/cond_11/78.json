Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications supporting the claim that Lorenzo de Medici's patronage of Da Vinci was exclusive, focusing on Lorenzo's exclusive patronage habits, his focus on a select group of artists, and the Medici family's dominance. However, the S-type arguments present contradictory evidence, such as Da Vinci receiving patronage from other figures, working for various patrons, and having independent projects. These S-type arguments undermine the claim and show that the justifications in the P-type arguments are not supported by all minimal semantic bases of the claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
