Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains at least one S-type argument's justification as a semantic subset, supporting the claim that Al Capone did not carry a smartphone. For example, the S-type argument about Al Capone dying before the invention of smartphones is a subset of the P-type argument about historical records showing no evidence of smartphones. Similarly, the S-type argument about the lack of modern cellular networks is a subset of the P-type argument about the technology not being developed during his time. Thus, C11 is satisfied.
