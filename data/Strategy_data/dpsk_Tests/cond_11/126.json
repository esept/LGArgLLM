Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide general scenarios where Electronic Arts could have profited from Metroid sales (e.g., through collaborations, licensing, or partnerships), but none of their justifications contain the specific minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments. The S-type arguments directly address the lack of evidence or mechanisms for EA to profit from Metroid sales, which are not subsets of the P-type justifications. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
