Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that months are based on lunar cycles and arbitrary divisions, not the solar cycle. The S-type arguments support these points by providing additional historical and etymological evidence. However, none of the P-type arguments' justifications contain the minimal semantic basis that months are based on the solar cycle, as the claim asserts. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
