Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that contradict the claim (stating that Christmas trees are typically evergreen, not deciduous). The S-type arguments also support the idea that Christmas trees are evergreen, not deciduous. Therefore, there is no P-type argument whose justification contains a semantic subset from the S-type arguments that supports the claim. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
