Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that cover the minimal semantic bases required to support the claim. Specifically, the first P-type argument states that Old English was spoken long before the Confederate States existed, and the second P-type argument confirms that Old English had evolved into Middle English by the 15th century, well before the Civil War. The S-type arguments further support these points by detailing the evolution of English and the type of English spoken in the Confederate States, which aligns with and reinforces the P-type justifications. Thus, every minimal semantic basis of the claim is covered by the P-type arguments.
