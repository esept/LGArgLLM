Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first and third arguments emphasize that Mario (in red and blue) is the primary focus, while the second argument points out that Luigi (in green) is the focus in certain titles. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim uniformly.
