Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by pointing out the lack of evidence, the unreliability of historical records, and the need for substantial proof to support such an accusation. There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim itself.
