Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on infrastructure and risks to other animals and visitors, the second on dietary and habitat needs, and the third on public safety concerns. While all are reasons against bringing a robusto to the zoo, they address distinct aspects (infrastructure, animal health, public safety) without overlapping in meaning.
