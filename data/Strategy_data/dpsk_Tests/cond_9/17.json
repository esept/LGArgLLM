Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification argues that the weight of 10 gallons of seawater is insufficient to crush a human body, the second focuses on the resilience of a six-year-old's body, and the third highlights the structural strength of human bones and tissues. While all oppose the claim, they do so from different angles without a shared semantic basis.
