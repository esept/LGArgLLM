Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. Some arguments support the claim by highlighting factors favoring Albany, GA (e.g., lower cost of living, higher state growth rate), while others argue the opposite by pointing to advantages for Albany, NY (e.g., metropolitan area benefits, urban migration trends). There is no intersection in meaning across all justifications.
