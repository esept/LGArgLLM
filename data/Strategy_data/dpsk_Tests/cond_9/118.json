Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that Focal Fossa is a version of Ubuntu, which is a Linux distribution built on the Linux kernel, and is recognized as such by official documentation, the community, and its design. This consistent overlap in meaning supports the claim that running Focal Fossa means using Linux.
