Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments highlight cultural and religious factors (e.g., pork consumption, traditional cuisine) that make BLTs hard to find, while others point to globalization and cosmopolitan influences (e.g., international restaurants, fast-food chains) that increase the likelihood of finding BLTs. These perspectives are contradictory rather than intersecting.
