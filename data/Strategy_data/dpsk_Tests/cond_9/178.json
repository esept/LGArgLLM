Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that blue is the most expensive color. While some arguments (e.g., ultramarine blue, YInMn Blue, Tyrian purple) support the claim by highlighting the rarity and cost of blue pigments, others (e.g., Carmine, Vantablack) contradict it by mentioning more expensive non-blue pigments. There is no intersection of all justifications that uniformly supports the claim.
