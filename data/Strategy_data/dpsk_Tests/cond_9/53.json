Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments suggest that Nobel's works (like 'Nemesis') were controversial or suppressed, while others explicitly state there is no documented evidence of official bans or that his writings were primarily scientific/personal and not banned. These justifications contradict each other rather than intersecting on a shared basis for the claim.
