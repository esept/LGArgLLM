Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments suggest that 'Rick and Morty' could be triggering due to themes of substance abuse and dysfunctional family dynamics (A1, A3, A4), others argue that the show's fantastical nature or viewers' coping mechanisms might prevent triggering (A2, A5). These perspectives are contradictory rather than intersecting.
