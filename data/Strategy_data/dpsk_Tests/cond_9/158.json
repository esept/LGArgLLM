Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first argument provides a specific count of Alec Baldwin's children, the second focuses on media prominence, and the third discusses Baldwin's vocal role as a father. None of these justifications directly compare the number of children between Alec Baldwin and Clint Eastwood, nor do they intersect in a way that collectively supports the claim based on a shared semantic basis.
