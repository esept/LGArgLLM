Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first and third arguments focus on the thematic and stylistic differences between Kurt Sutter's work and Disney's adaptations, while the second argument introduces the possibility of indirect involvement of Sutter's collaborators in unrelated capacities. There is no intersection in meaning across all three justifications.
