Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on the lack of scientific evidence linking cowbells to fever reduction, while the second argument discusses the negligible placebo effect compared to established treatments. These are distinct points and do not intersect semantically.
