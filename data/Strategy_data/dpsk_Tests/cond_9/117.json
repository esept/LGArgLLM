Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments suggest that language barriers are mitigated (e.g., English widely spoken, English signage, mobile apps in English), while others imply potential confusion due to cultural differences or familiarity with Disney parks. There is no single shared semantic basis across all justifications.
