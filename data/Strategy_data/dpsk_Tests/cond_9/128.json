Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They all revolve around the idea that Conan O'Brien's show airs late at night (after 11 PM), which conflicts with the typical earlier bedtimes of children (between 8 PM and 10 PM). This overlap in meaning consistently supports the claim that most children would be up past their bedtime if they were watching Conan O'Brien.
