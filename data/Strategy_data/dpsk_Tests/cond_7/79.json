Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, the arguments about the general health of northern fur seals (A1) and their good health in July (A3) share a common semantic subset related to the physiological condition of the seals. Similarly, the arguments about veterinary advancements (A2) and specialized veterinary teams (A4) both relate to the expertise and protocols available for anesthesia. Since there are overlapping semantic subsets, the justifications are not disjoint.
