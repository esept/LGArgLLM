Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they address different aspects supporting the claim. The first justification focuses on the box office gross of King Kong, the second compares it to other films in Watts' career, and the third discusses the budget and marketing scale. While all support the claim, they do not overlap in their reasoning.
