Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically. All arguments discuss Aretha Franklin's age and eligibility to vote in relation to the birth of her second child and the U.S. voting age at the time. They all converge on the point that she could have voted in the 1964 presidential election after turning 21, even though her second child was born in 1960. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
