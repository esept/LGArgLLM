Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the absence of a monarchy or nobility system in the U.S., while the second argument cites a specific constitutional prohibition on titles of nobility. Although both support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping reasoning.
