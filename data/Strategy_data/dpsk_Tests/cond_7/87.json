Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the presence of Vitamin C in lemons or lemonade. For example, the first, third, and fifth arguments all reference the fact that lemons or lemon juice contain Vitamin C, either through natural sources, nutritional studies, or USDA data. The second and fourth arguments also relate to how Vitamin C is retained or extracted in lemonade. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
