Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument states that Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline continued through James VI/I, while the second argument focuses on the lack of evidence that the Gunpowder Plot targeted her descendants. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
