Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments A1, A2, and A3 all focus on the potential physical harm caused by a jackfruit being thrown at a person's head, but they do so from slightly different angles (weight, force, and size/weight respectively). While they are related in theme, they do not share an identical semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
