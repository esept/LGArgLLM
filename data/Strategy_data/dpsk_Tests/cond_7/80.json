Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct reason why the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena was inadequate for hosting Coachella (e.g., capacity, space requirements, infrastructure, brand alignment, and demolition). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
