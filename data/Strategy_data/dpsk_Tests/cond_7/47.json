Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument discusses historical ties like the Louisiana Purchase, while another focuses on French military officers volunteering due to ideals of liberty. Another argument mentions France's official neutrality, and yet another refers to French immigrants enlisting. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
