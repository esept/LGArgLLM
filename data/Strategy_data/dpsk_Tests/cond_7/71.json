Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments discuss the feasibility of uploading 1000GB in a fortnight under different conditions (optimal speeds, 50% of advertised speeds, and business/enterprise plans), but they all relate to the same core idea of the upload capability of Centurylink's internet plan. Therefore, they share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
