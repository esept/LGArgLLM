Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to Stinky Peterson frequently being on his porch in Hey Arnold. They all reinforce the idea that Stinky is often seen on his porch, either through direct observation, recurring settings, or interactions with other characters. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
