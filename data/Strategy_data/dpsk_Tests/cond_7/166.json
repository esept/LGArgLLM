Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint, as they both rely on the historical timeline of the English language to argue that Old English was not spoken by the Confederate States. The first justification points out the time gap between Old English and the Confederate States, while the second emphasizes the evolution of Old English into Middle English before the Civil War. Both contribute to the same line of reasoning against the claim.
