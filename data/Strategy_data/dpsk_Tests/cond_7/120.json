Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and third arguments both mention the use of single-handed weapons by gladiators, while the second and fourth arguments discuss scenarios where both gladiators and Faust might use two hands. However, there is at least one pair (e.g., the first and second arguments) where the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claimâ€”one focuses on one-handed weapons and the other on two-handed weapons.
