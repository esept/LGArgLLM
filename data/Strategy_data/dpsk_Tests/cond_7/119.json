Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that Darth Vader's identity and backstory are revealed in the Star Wars films, and that the films are the primary or authoritative source for understanding his character. These justifications share a common semantic subset that supports the claim, so they are not disjoint.
