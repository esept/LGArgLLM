Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the War Doctor's significant role in a single special, while another highlights the Twelfth Doctor's extensive screen time across multiple seasons. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
