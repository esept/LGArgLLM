Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the lack of scientific evidence for quartz in Internal Medicine, the second on the absence of quartz in homeopathic pharmacopeias, and the third on the non-endorsement by major medical organizations. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
