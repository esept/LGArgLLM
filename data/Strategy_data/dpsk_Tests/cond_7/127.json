Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (runtime comparison, release year discrepancy, temporal overlap impossibility, and general duration comparison) that does not overlap with the others in supporting the claim. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
