Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct mechanism by which cancer can cause excess adrenaline production (e.g., pheochromocytomas secreting adrenaline, neuroendocrine tumors disrupting hormone regulation, metastatic cancers affecting adrenal glands, chronic stress activating the sympathetic nervous system, and ectopic ACTH production). None of the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim; each presents a unique pathway or scenario.
