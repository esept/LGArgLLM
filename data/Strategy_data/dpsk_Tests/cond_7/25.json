Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all revolve around the same core idea: the legal and practical impossibility of San Antonio citizens voting in UK elections involving Boris Johnson. While each argument presents slightly different aspects (e.g., Boris Johnson's political scope, voting restrictions, electoral systems), they all contribute to the same overarching support for the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
