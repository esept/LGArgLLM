Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the zoo's infrastructure and risks to other animals and visitors, the second on dietary and habitat needs, and the third on public safety concerns. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
