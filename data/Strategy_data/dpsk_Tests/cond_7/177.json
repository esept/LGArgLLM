Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are all related to the absence of human presence on Mars (and specifically Mount Sharp), but they each provide distinct reasons (e.g., location on Mars, robotic missions, environmental conditions, historical records, technological limitations). There is no semantic overlap in their justifications that directly supports the claim in the same wayâ€”each justification stands independently. Thus, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
