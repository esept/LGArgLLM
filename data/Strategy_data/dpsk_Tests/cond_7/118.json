Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. They all revolve around the idea that Focal Fossa is a version of Ubuntu, which is a Linux distribution, and that it uses the Linux kernel. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
