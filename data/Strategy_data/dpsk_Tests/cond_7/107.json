Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on Conan's disadvantage due to reliance on technology and teamwork in Call of Duty, while another highlights his potential adaptability and survival skills. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
