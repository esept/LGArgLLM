Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct reason why a diet of ice would eventually kill a person (e.g., lack of essential nutrients, caloric deficiency, hypothermia, digestive complications, and electrolyte imbalance). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
