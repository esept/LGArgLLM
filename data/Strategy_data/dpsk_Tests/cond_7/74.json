Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content, as they all focus on the absence of tricarboxylic acids in watermelon and its safety for individuals with this allergy. For example, multiple arguments mention the lack of tricarboxylic acids in watermelon's composition or biochemical pathways, and others reference clinical studies or nutritional profiles confirming this absence. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
