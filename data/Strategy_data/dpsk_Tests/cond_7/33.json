Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason for why bodies move during hanging (e.g., involuntary muscle contractions, rope dynamics, neurological reflexes, gravity and tension, historical records). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
