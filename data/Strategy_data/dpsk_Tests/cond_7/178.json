Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or example (e.g., ultramarine blue, YInMn Blue, Carmine, Vantablack, Tyrian purple) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. They each highlight different aspects or examples of expensive colors without sharing a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
