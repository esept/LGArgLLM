Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument provides a factual count of Alec Baldwin's children, the second focuses on media prominence, and the third discusses Baldwin's vocal role as a father. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim about the number of children.
