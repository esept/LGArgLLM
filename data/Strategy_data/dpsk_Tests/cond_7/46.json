Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the etymology of the word "month" and its connection to lunar cycles, while the second argument discusses the arbitrary division of months in the Gregorian calendar. There is no overlap in their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
