Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that the Catholic Church's requirements for the pope (baptized and practicing Catholic, affirming doctrines, membership in clergy, election by committed Catholics) are incompatible with agnosticism. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
