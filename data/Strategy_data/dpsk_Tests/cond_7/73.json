Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Pollock's personal struggle with alcoholism, while the second argument addresses the temporal mismatch between Pollock's lifetime and the emergence of the straight edge movement. These points do not overlap in meaning or contribute to the claim in a shared way.
