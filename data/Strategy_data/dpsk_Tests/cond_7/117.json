Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content regarding language support and familiarity for American visitors at Disneyland Paris. For example, arguments about English being widely spoken and the availability of English-language resources (e.g., apps, signage) share common themes. Thus, no pair of arguments is fully disjoint in their justifications with respect to the claim.
