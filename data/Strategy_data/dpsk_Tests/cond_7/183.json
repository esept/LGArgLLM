Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the availability of chlorine or chlorine-based products (e.g., bleach, pool chlorine tablets) at dollar stores. The justifications overlap in meaning, as they all support the claim by referencing different forms or uses of chlorine that are commonly sold in dollar stores. None of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
