Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic theme: the physical dimensions and properties of a Nike shoebox compared to the size and anatomy of a swan. Each argument reinforces the claim by highlighting different aspects of this comparison (e.g., dimensions, anatomy, volume, structural integrity), but none are semantically disjoint. They all contribute to the same overarching reasoning that a swan cannot fit in a Nike shoebox.
