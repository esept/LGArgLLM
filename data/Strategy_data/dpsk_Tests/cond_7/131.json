Result: false
Justification: All arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim (that people are not banned from entering the Forbidden City). Each argument provides different evidence (e.g., UNESCO status, visitor numbers, government promotion, historical records, official website information, international tourists) that collectively refutes the claim. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
