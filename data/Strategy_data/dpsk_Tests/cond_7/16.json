Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both reference the stadium's capacity and its relation to Gothenburg's population, indicating an overlap in semantic content supporting the claim. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both discuss the stadium's ability to serve a significant portion of the city's residents, further showing semantic overlap. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have disjoint justifications.
