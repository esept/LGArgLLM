Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on genetic diversity and ancestry as a reason for Sara Paxton being considered Latino, while the second argument discusses cultural contributions or roles as a basis for Latino identity. These two justifications do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
