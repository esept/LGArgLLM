Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the lack of scientific evidence linking cowbells to fever reduction, while the second argument discusses the negligible placebo effect compared to established treatments. These justifications address different aspects (scientific evidence vs. placebo effect) and do not overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
