Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct reasons supporting the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the difference in the number of items (scrolls vs. modern items), another on storage methods (scrolls vs. standardized book formats), another on multimedia collections, another on the scope and expansion needs, and the last on the physical infrastructure. None of these justifications overlap in their semantic contribution to the claim.
