Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., no known physical restrictions, meeting height requirement, no fear of roller coasters, public participation history, and body type accommodation) that does not overlap with the others in supporting the claim.
