Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. They all revolve around the idea that twins are born within a very short time frame (minutes, hours, or the same day), which ensures they are born in the same year. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
