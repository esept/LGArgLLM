Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on Pollock's personal struggle with alcoholism, while the second argument addresses the anachronism of associating Pollock with a movement that emerged after his death. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
