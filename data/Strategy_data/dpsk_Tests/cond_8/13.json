Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the numerical impossibility (7 dwarfs vs. minimum 3 players per game), while the second argument discusses the practical constraints (complexity and time requirements of the game). There is no common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
