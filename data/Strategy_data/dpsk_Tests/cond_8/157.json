Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about Casablanca being a predominantly Muslim city where pork is not widely consumed does not share a common idea with the argument about high-end supermarkets importing bacon. Similarly, the argument about traditional Moroccan cuisine not including BLTs does not overlap with the argument about globalization spreading Western fast-food chains. While some pairs may share overlapping justifications (e.g., the arguments about international restaurants and globalization both mention the influence of Western culture), not all pairs do.
