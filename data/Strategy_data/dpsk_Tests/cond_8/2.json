Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references the USDA's recommended fat intake or dietary guidelines and demonstrates how consuming seven McDonald's hamburgers would exceed or nearly meet these recommendations. The common ideas include the total fat content of seven hamburgers, the USDA's daily fat limits, and the principle of moderation in fat consumption.
