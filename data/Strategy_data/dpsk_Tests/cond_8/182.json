Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share overlapping themes such as resilience, personal growth, and positive influence, not all pairs have direct semantic overlap in their justifications. For example, the argument about his portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man focuses on his fictional character's qualities, which does not directly overlap with the argument about his stable family life and long-term marriage. Similarly, his philanthropic efforts do not directly intersect with his career rebuilding. Thus, not all pairs share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
