Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the absence of a monarchy or nobility system in the U.S., while the second argument cites a specific constitutional prohibition on titles of nobility. Although both relate to the claim, their justifications do not intersect in terms of common ideas or reasoning patterns.
