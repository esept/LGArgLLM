Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the weight of the seawater, the second on the resilience of a child's body, and the third on the structural design of human bones and tissues. While all three arguments oppose the claim, they do so based on distinct and non-overlapping justifications.
