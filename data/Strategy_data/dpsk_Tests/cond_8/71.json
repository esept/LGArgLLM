Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The common idea is the feasibility of uploading 1000GB in a fortnight given the upload speeds and conditions provided by Centurylink's internet plans. Each argument discusses different scenarios (optimal conditions, 50% advertised speed, business plans) but all converge on the same underlying reasoning about upload speeds and timeframes.
