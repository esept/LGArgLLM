Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on Jon Jones's black belt status and advanced proficiency, while the second emphasizes his demonstrated grappling skills in professional fights. Although both support the idea that Jon Jones is highly skilled, they do so through distinct reasoning patterns (belt rank vs. in-fight performance), and neither directly addresses the possibility of a white belt defeating him. Thus, there is no common idea or proposition in their justifications that directly supports the claim.
