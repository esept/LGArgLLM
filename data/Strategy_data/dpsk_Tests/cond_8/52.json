Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the fictional nature of Lannisters and their inability to interact with real-world objects, while the second argument emphasizes the laws of physics and biology preventing inanimate objects from affecting fictional beings. These are distinct lines of reasoning without a common idea or proposition.
