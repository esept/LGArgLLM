Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that cancer can lead to excess adrenaline production, either directly through tumor secretion (A1, A2, A5), interference with adrenal gland function (A3), or indirectly through stress responses (A4). Each pair of arguments overlaps in their justification by addressing different mechanisms by which cancer affects adrenaline levels, all supporting the claim.
