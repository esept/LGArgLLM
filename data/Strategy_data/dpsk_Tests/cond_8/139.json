Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either references the band's lyrics, public statements, or activism that critiques globalization, corporate dominance, or economic exploitation. For example, arguments about their lyrics (e.g., 'B.Y.O.B.' and 'Toxicity') and their activism (e.g., WTO protests) all converge on the theme of opposing globalization. The Armenian heritage argument also ties into broader critiques of global power structures, which aligns with the other justifications.
