Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the French Defense's prominence in chess education, professional training, high-level play, and resources (like databases and books), which collectively support the idea that grandmasters are familiar with it. The common themes of widespread knowledge, professional expectation, and practical usage ensure semantic overlap across all pairs.
