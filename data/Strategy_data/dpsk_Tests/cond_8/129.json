Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on vegans choosing to eat paella if it is prepared without animal products, the second on flexible vegans who might occasionally consume such dishes, and the third on vegan versions of paella. These are distinct reasons without overlapping semantic content.
