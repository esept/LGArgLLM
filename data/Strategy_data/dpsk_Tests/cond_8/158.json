Result: false
Justification: The first argument provides a specific count of Alec Baldwin's children (seven), while the second argument focuses on the media prominence of Baldwin's children, and the third discusses Baldwin's vocal role as a father. There is no overlapping semantic justification between the first and second or first and third arguments regarding the actual number of children. The second and third arguments also do not share a common idea about the number of children, only about Baldwin's public image related to his children. Therefore, not all pairs share semantic intersections in their justifications.
