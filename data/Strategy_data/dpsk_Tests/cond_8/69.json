Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common theme of explaining how anorexia nervosa leads to increased bone fragility and fracture risk, albeit through different mechanisms (malnutrition, low body weight, hormonal imbalances, osteoporosis, nutrient deprivation, and reduced muscle mass). Each pair of arguments overlaps in addressing the claim by discussing aspects of bone health deterioration due to anorexia.
