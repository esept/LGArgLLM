Result: false
Justification: While most pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the inadequacy of the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena for hosting Coachella (e.g., capacity, infrastructure, setting), the argument about the arena being demolished in 2016 does not share a common idea or reasoning pattern with the other arguments. This argument is about the impossibility of hosting any events due to the arena's demolition, which is a distinct point from the other arguments focusing on the arena's inadequacy for Coachella's specific needs.
