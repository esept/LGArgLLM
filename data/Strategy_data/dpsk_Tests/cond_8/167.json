Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. Each argument presents a distinct reason why biochemistry does not study gluons (scope of biochemistry, academic curricula, research publications), but there is no overlap in their justifications beyond the general negation of the claim.
