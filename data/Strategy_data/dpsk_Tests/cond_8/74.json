Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on the absence of tricarboxylic acids in watermelon, either by discussing its composition, biochemical pathways, clinical studies, nutritional profile, or allergen databases. This common theme ensures that every pair of arguments intersects in their reasoning about why watermelon is safe for people with a tricarboxylic acid allergy.
