Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument centers on the idea that Aretha Franklin met the age requirement (21) by the time of the 1964 presidential election, which occurred after her second child was born in 1960. This common reasoning pattern ensures that every pair of arguments intersects semantically on the key point supporting the claim.
