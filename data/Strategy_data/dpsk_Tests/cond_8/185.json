Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on evidence-based treatments in Internal Medicine, the second on the absence of quartz in homeopathic pharmacopeias, and the third on guidelines from organizations like WHO and CDC. There is no semantic overlap between these justifications.
