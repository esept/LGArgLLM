Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the Ottoman Empire, an Islamic entity, controlled the Land of Israel in the 16th century. Each justification either directly states this fact or provides supporting evidence (historical records, conquest details, administrative reforms, or traveler accounts) that reinforce the same central claim. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in their support for the claim.
