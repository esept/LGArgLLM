Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses frogs' behavioral responses (avoidance, distinguishing, or rejecting) to certain stimuli (toxic/spoiled food, unpalatable substances, harmful substances) as evidence of a disgust-like response. The core idea of frogs exhibiting behaviors indicative of disgust is common across all justifications.
