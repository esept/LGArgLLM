Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. For example, one argument states that the War Doctor had substantial screen time in the 50th-anniversary special, while another argues that the Twelfth Doctor had far more screen time due to three full seasons. These justifications are contradictory and do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
