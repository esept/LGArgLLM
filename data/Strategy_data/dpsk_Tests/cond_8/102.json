Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that Apollo 13 had no fatalities, while other space missions (Apollo 1, Challenger, Columbia, Soyuz 11, Vostok) had fatalities. This overlapping semantic justification supports the claim that the deaths from Apollo 13 were eclipsed by other space missions.
