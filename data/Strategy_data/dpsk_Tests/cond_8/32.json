Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument presents a distinct reason (lack of historical records, social norms, scarcity of documentation, and need for substantial proof) without a common idea or proposition that directly supports the claim in the same way.
