Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to Marco Rubio's ability to ride the Candymonium roller coaster. For example, all arguments either address his physical ability (height, physique), lack of restrictions (medical, fear), or his public persona (participation in events). These overlapping themes ensure that every pair of arguments has a semantic intersection in their justifications.
