Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the etymology of the word "month" and its connection to lunar cycles, while the second argument discusses the arbitrary division of months in the Gregorian calendar. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
