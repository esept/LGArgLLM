Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping justifications (e.g., the layered structure of shallots and their use as substitutes), others introduce conflicting or non-overlapping ideas (e.g., the difficulty due to smaller size vs. the possibility with careful preparation). Not all pairs share a common semantic justification in relation to the claim.
