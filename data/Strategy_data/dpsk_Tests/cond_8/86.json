Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the red and white colors on Marlboro packages overlap with the colors of the French flag (blue, white, and red). Each justification explicitly mentions this overlap, either by stating the partial match or noting that Marlboro's colors are a subset of the French flag's colors. Therefore, all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
