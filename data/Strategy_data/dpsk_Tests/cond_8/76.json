Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that music can be used to manipulate, control, or harm individuals or groups, whether through psychological, physical, or emotional means. Each justification relates to the claim by highlighting different contexts (e.g., warfare, torture, propaganda) where music serves as a weapon, thus ensuring semantic overlap between all pairs of arguments.
