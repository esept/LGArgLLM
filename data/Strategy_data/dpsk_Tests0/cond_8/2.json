Result: false
Justification: While most pairs of arguments share semantic overlap in discussing how seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed USDA recommended fat or dietary limits, the argument about sodium content (A4) does not directly relate to the fat allowance claim. The other arguments focus on fat intake (total fat, saturated fat, or percentage of calories from fat), whereas A4 introduces sodium content, which is a different nutritional aspect. Therefore, not all pairs share semantic intersections relevant to the claim about fat allowance.
