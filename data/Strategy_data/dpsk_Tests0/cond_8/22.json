Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the argument about fire hazards does not overlap semantically with the argument about personal relaxation, as they address entirely different concerns (safety vs. personal enjoyment). Similarly, the argument about designated smoking areas does not share semantic overlap with the argument about animal welfare. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping justifications.
