Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument highlights a distinct aspect of how anatomical and symbolic hearts differ in appearance, structure, or function, reinforcing the claim. For example, the first argument discusses the structural differences, the second emphasizes the lack of functional resemblance, the third connects the symbolic heart to abstract concepts, the fourth mentions educational differentiation, and the fifth focuses on aesthetic and recognition differences. Despite these varied angles, all justifications ultimately support the claim that anatomical and symbolic hearts look remarkably different, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
