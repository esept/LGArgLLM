Result: false
Justification: The arguments A1, A2, and A4 share overlapping semantic justifications related to amoebas hosting or protecting Yersinia pestis, which could facilitate the spread of the Black Death. However, argument A3 does not share this common idea; instead, it focuses on the lack of direct evidence linking amoebas to the Black Death and emphasizes the primary role of fleas on rodents. Thus, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications.
