Result: false
Justification: While all arguments individually support the claim by providing examples of mythical creatures whose names are also used for Small Solar System bodies, the justifications do not overlap semantically beyond this general pattern. Each argument introduces a distinct example (Centaur, Phoenix, Dragon, Pegasus, Cyclops) without sharing any common reasoning or propositions beyond the claim itself. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
