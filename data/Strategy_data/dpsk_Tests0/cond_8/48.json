Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that there is no evidence linking ancient writings to Cthulhu, while the second argument suggests that if Cthulhu mythos is inspired by ancient texts, paleography could analyze those sources. These justifications do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
