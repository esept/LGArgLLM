Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the unique and essential role of grapes in winemaking, whether through their chemical composition, historical use, or their role in fermentation and flavor determination. For example, the necessity of grapes for fermentation (A1, A4, A5) and their role in determining wine quality (A3) are recurring themes that intersect across multiple arguments.
