Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the size of the cubs and the dimensions of the king size bed. The first argument discusses the size of the cubs, the second discusses the size of the bed, and the third combines these ideas by stating that the cubs' combined size would occupy only a fraction of the bed's surface area. Thus, all arguments are interconnected through the common theme of size and space.
