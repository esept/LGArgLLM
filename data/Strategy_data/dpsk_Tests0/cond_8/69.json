Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses how anorexia nervosa leads to conditions (e.g., malnutrition, hormonal imbalances, low body weight, nutritional deficiencies) that weaken bones and increase fracture risk. The common theme across all justifications is the direct or indirect impact of anorexia nervosa on bone health, making them semantically interconnected.
