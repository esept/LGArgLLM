Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument revolves around the idea that U.S. citizens, including those in San Antonio, cannot vote in U.K. elections due to legal and jurisdictional barriers. The justifications consistently emphasize the sovereignty of electoral systems, the citizenship requirements for voting in U.K. elections, and the lack of legal mechanisms for foreign participation. These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments intersects semantically.
