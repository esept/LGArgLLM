Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first argument focuses on the box office gross of King Kong (2005), the second on the publicity and recognition of Naomi Watts' role, the third on the budget and marketing campaign, and the fourth on the comparison with smaller, independent films. While some pairs may overlap (e.g., first and third arguments both discuss box office performance), not all pairs do (e.g., second and fourth arguments focus on different aspects of Watts' career).
