Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the weight of the seawater being insufficient, the second on the extreme pressures required for crushing injuries, and the third on the distribution of force. These are distinct points without semantic overlap.
