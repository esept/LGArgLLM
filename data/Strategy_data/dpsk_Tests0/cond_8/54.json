Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the voting age and local election rules, the second on state and local variations in voting age, and the third on Aretha Franklin's involvement in the civil rights movement. There is no semantic overlap in their justifications.
