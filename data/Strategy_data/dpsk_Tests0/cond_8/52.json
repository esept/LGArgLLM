Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share any overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that French Toast lacks inherent lethal properties, while the second argument focuses on the absence of a known harmful mechanism. Although both argue against the claim, they do so based on different reasoning (lack of properties vs. lack of mechanism), and thus do not share a common idea or proposition.
