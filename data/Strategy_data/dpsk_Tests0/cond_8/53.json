Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that directly supports the claim. Each argument provides a different reason (Nobel's prolific writing, the 19th-century political climate, and his involvement in explosives) for why his book might have been banned, but these reasons are distinct and do not overlap semantically.
