Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim that the Bactrian Camel is the most impressive animal in terms of number of humps. Each argument either directly states or implies that the Bactrian Camel has two humps, which is more than any other camel species or mammal, making it unique in this regard. This common idea is present in all justifications, ensuring semantic overlap for every pair.
