Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. Each argument's justification discusses aspects of the admission or hiring process (e.g., acceptance rates, required qualifications, evaluation stages) that highlight the comparative ease of entering the University of Pittsburgh versus the FBI. The common theme across all justifications is the contrast in the rigor and requirements between the two institutions, supporting the claim.
