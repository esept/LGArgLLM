Result: false
Justification: The first argument states that the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice in December is closer to January than to July, while the second argument states that the Southern Hemisphere's winter solstice in June is closer to July than the Northern Hemisphere's December solstice. These justifications do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern; they focus on different aspects of the solstice timing in different hemispheres. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications.
