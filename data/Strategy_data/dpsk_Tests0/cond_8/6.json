Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument focuses on the physical dimensions or properties of a Nike shoebox and how they are incompatible with the size, weight, or structure of an adult swan. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the size discrepancy (shoebox dimensions vs. swan wingspan), the third and fourth arguments both highlight the shoebox's inability to support a swan (structural integrity vs. weight capacity), and so on. The common theme across all justifications is the mismatch between the shoebox's capabilities and the swan's physical attributes.
