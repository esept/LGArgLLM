Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument states that historical records indicate polygamous relationships, while the second argues there is no verifiable evidence of non-monogamous relationships. These are contradictory and do not share common reasoning or propositions. The third argument introduces cultural practices as a possible justification, which is distinct from the other two. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share semantic intersections.
