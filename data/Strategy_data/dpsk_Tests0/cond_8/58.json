Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to Pan's role as a deity relevant to shepherds and flocks. The first and second arguments both mention Pan's connection to shepherds and flocks, the first and third both highlight Pan's protective or favorable role for shepherds, and the second and third both emphasize Pan's influence over nature or rustic settings. Thus, every pair has at least one common idea supporting the claim.
