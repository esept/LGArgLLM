Result: false
Justification: While all arguments oppose the claim by asserting that agnosticism is incompatible with the requirements for being pope, their justifications do not semantically overlap in a way that every pair shares a common idea. For example, the first argument focuses on the requirement of being a baptized and practicing Catholic, while the second argument emphasizes the need to affirm faith in Catholic doctrine. These are related but distinct points. Similarly, other arguments bring up different aspects (e.g., canon law, election process, role of the pope) without overlapping in their justifications. Thus, not all pairs share a semantic intersection.
