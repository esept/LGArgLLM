Result: false
Justification: The first two arguments share semantic overlap in their justifications, as both discuss the potential for injury due to the size and weight of the jackfruit. However, the third argument introduces a different idea—that minimal force and short distance might not cause injury—which does not overlap with the justifications of the first two arguments. Therefore, not all pairs share semantic intersections.
