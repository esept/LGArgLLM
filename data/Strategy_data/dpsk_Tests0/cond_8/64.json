Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Microsoft Excel's functionality, whether through direct hardware operation, electronic calculations, or cloud-based services, fundamentally depends on electricity. Each pair of arguments overlaps in emphasizing this dependency, either by focusing on hardware requirements, electronic processing, or the broader infrastructure (like internet or batteries) that relies on electricity. Thus, all justifications semantically intersect in supporting the claim.
