Result: false
Justification: The arguments share some common themes (e.g., French involvement in the American Civil War), but not all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about France's neutrality does not overlap semantically with the argument about French arms manufacturers supplying weapons, as they address different aspects of involvement (official policy vs. private sector actions).
