Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct aspect (fire hazards, health concerns, animal welfare, policy compliance, and visitor relaxation) without overlapping in their supporting reasons. For example, the argument about fire hazards does not share semantic content with the argument about visitor relaxation. Thus, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
