Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. They all discuss the differences between the giant panda's coloration and the yin yang symbol in terms of visual pattern, purpose, distribution, and origin. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
