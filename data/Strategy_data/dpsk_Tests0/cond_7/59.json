Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint as they all share a common theme of contrasting the anatomical heart with the symbolic heart in terms of structure, function, and representation. For example, arguments about the structural differences (e.g., chambers and valves vs. simplified shape) and the functional differences (e.g., biological function vs. emotional representation) overlap in their contribution to the claim that the two types of hearts look remarkably different.
