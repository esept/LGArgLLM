Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint in some pairs. For example, the first argument focuses on the box office gross of King Kong, while the fourth argument discusses Naomi Watts' involvement in smaller films like Mulholland Drive, which does not share a common semantic subset with the first argument regarding box office performance. Thus, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
