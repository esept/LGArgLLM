Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around the incompatibility of agnosticism with the requirements and duties of the pope as defined by the Catholic Church. While they address different aspects (e.g., baptism, faith affirmation, canon law, election process, leadership role), they do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Each justification provides a distinct reason why an agnostic cannot become pope, making them semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
