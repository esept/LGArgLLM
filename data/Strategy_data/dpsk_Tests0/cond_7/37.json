Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content regarding the timing of the winter solstice in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. For example, multiple arguments mention that the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice occurs in December, which is a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
