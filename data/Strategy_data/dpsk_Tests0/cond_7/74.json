Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content regarding the safety of watermelon for people with a tricarboxylic acid allergy. For example, multiple arguments mention the absence or low concentration of specific acids (e.g., citric acid) in watermelon, and the general hypoallergenic nature of watermelon. These points are repeated or closely related across different arguments, indicating that their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
