Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in meaning with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the role of grapes in fermentation (e.g., "providing the necessary sugars, acids, and tannins for fermentation" and "contain natural yeasts on their skins that can initiate the fermentation process"). Additionally, the historical and chemical aspects of grapes are mentioned in multiple arguments, further indicating semantic overlap. Thus, no pair of arguments is entirely disjoint.
