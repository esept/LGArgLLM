Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or aspect of French involvement (diplomatic relations, military observers, policy of neutrality, arms supply) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
