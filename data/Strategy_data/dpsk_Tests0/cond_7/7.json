Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first two arguments focus on the religious and moral implications of eating pork, while the last two arguments discuss the ethical considerations in extreme survival situations. There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications that directly supports the claim in the same way.
