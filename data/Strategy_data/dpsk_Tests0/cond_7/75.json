Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the regulatory framework preventing homelessness, while the second justification addresses the logistical and survival challenges that make homelessness impossible. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
