Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument discusses how grief may be suppressed, the second focuses on observable symptoms, and the third highlights clinician-recognizable patterns. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
