Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. They all discuss Christopher Columbus's role as an Italian explorer in naming Caribbean islands, particularly Saint Vincent, and his influence during the early exploration of the Americas. Since none of the pairs of justifications are disjoint, the result is false.
