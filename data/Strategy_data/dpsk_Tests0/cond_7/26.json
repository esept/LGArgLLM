Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or mechanism by which cancer can cause excess adrenaline production (e.g., pheochromocytomas, neuroendocrine tumors, cancer-related stress responses, metastatic cancers affecting adrenal glands, paraneoplastic syndromes). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
