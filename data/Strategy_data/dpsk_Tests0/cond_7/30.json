Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share overlapping semantic content related to the definition of Latino identity and the diversity of phenotypes in Latin America. For example, the first and fourth arguments both discuss the diversity of physical appearances among Latinos, while the second and fourth arguments both mention the presence of blonde hair and green eyes in Latin America. Therefore, no pair of arguments is completely disjoint with respect to the claim.
