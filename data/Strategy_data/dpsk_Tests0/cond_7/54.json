Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the voting age and local election eligibility, the second on jurisdictional variations in voting age, and the third on civil rights activism unrelated to her personal voting eligibility. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
