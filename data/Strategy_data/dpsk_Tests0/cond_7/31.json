Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., acceptance rates, required tests, evaluation criteria, process duration, prior experience) that does not overlap with the others in contributing to the support of the claim.
