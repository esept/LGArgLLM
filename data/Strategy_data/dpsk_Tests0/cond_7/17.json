Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all address the same core issue (the claim's inaccuracy due to insufficient pressure from ten gallons of seawater) but from slightly different angles (weight, typical crushing pressures, and force distribution). However, since the question asks whether at least one pair is disjoint, and none of the pairs are fully disjoint in meaning, the correct answer is false. But given the phrasing of the task, the output should reflect that no pair is disjoint, hence the result is false.
