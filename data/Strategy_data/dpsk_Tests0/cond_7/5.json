Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the warm climate and typical weather conditions in Hollywood in July, which collectively support the claim that wearing a coat is unnecessary. For example, the first and second arguments both reference temperature data, while the third and fourth arguments discuss typical clothing choices and humidity levels, respectively. These justifications overlap in their support of the claim by addressing different aspects of the same underlying weather conditions.
