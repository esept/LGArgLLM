Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument states that there is no evidence linking ancient writings to Cthulhu, while the second argument suggests that paleography could theoretically analyze ancient texts if they were inspired by Cthulhu mythos. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
