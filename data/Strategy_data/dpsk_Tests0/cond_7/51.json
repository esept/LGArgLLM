Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct genre or context (e.g., science fiction, post-apocalyptic, superhero stories, documentaries/dramas, horror, crime dramas) where radioactive waste is used as a plot device, without overlapping in their semantic contributions to the claim.
