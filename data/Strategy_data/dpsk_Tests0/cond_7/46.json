Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument discusses the Gregorian calendar aligning months with the solar year, while the third argument states that months are based on lunar cycles, not the solar cycle. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim, making them disjoint.
