Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all support the claim by highlighting different aspects of why citizens of San Antonio could not have voted for Boris Johnson (e.g., jurisdictional boundaries, legal restrictions, and voting requirements). However, they are not semantically disjoint as they all revolve around the same core idea of legal and jurisdictional barriers preventing San Antonio citizens from voting in U.K. elections. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are entirely unrelated or disjoint in their contribution to the claim.
