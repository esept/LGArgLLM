Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on Cyndi Lauper's advocacy for animal rights and veganism, the second on general celebrity trends toward plant-based diets for health reasons, and the third on the lack of public record of her deviating from traditional recipes. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
