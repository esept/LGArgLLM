Result: true
Justification: The justifications for each argument are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, as each argument provides a distinct example of a mythical creature whose name is also used for a Small Solar System body (e.g., Centaur, Phoenix, Dragon, Pegasus, Cyclops). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
