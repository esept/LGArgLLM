Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to Ada Lovelace's age at death (36) being significantly below the average life expectancy for her era. They all contribute to the claim by providing overlapping evidence about her premature death, either through statistical comparisons or contemporary perspectives. Thus, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
