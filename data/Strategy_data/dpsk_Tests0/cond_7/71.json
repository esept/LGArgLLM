Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the excessive time frame for uploading 1000 GB with modern internet plans, the second calculates the implied upload speed and compares it to CenturyLink's capabilities, and the third discusses the optimization of consumer internet plans for high-speed usage. Each justification addresses a different aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
