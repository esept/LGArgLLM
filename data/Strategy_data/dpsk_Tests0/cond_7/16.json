Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument uses the total population of Gothenburg (600,000) to show that the stadium's capacity (16,000) is close to 10% of that figure. The second argument focuses on the urban core population, which is smaller, to argue that the stadium's capacity could approach a tenth of that smaller figure. These justifications rely on different population bases (total vs. urban core) and thus do not share a common semantic subset in supporting the claim.
