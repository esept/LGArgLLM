Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on thematic similarities (e.g., character being swallowed by a large creature), while another discusses the lack of documented evidence of intentional borrowing. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
