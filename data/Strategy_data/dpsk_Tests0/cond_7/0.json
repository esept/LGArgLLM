Result: true
Justification: The first two arguments share a common semantic subset (potential for injury due to the size/weight of the jackfruit), but the third argument introduces a disjoint justification (minimal force/short distance might not cause injury). Thus, there exists at least one pair of arguments (e.g., the first/third or second/third) with semantically disjoint justifications.
