Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. For example, the first argument discusses amoebas hosting and protecting pathogens, the second focuses on amoebas as reservoirs in the environment, the third emphasizes the lack of direct evidence linking amoebas to the Black Death, and the fourth highlights laboratory studies on amoebas ingesting and releasing Yersinia pestis. These justifications address different aspects and do not overlap semantically in supporting the claim.
