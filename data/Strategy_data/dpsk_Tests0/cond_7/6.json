Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing different but overlapping reasons why a Nike shoebox is too small to fit a swan in. For example, the first argument mentions the shoebox's dimensions, the second the swan's wingspan, the third the shoebox's design, and the fourth the swan's weight. While each argument provides a distinct reason, they all contribute to the same conclusion about the shoebox's inadequacy for containing a swan. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are completely disjoint with respect to the claim.
