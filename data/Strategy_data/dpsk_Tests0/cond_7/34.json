Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each address different aspects of why Bruce Gandy would be an odd choice for Messiah (Handel). For example, one focuses on his background as a bagpiper, another on vocal range requirements, another on historical traditions, and the last on audience expectations. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim.
