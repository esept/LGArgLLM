Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument cites historical records of polygamy, the second states there is no verifiable evidence of non-monogamy, and the third refers to cultural practices permitting non-monogamy. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
