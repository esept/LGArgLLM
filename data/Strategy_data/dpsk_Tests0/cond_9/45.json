Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument suggests that barley is needed for standard beer production, while the second argument explicitly states there is no evidence for any unique need for barley beyond standard requirements. These justifications contradict rather than support each other.
