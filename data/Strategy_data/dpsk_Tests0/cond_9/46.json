Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments (e.g., Gregorian and ancient calendars aligning months with the solar year) support the claim, others (e.g., months being based on lunar cycles or not corresponding to the solar year) contradict it. There is no intersection in meaning across all justifications.
