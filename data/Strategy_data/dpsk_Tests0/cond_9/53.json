Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. While they all suggest reasons why Alfred Nobel might have written a banned book, they focus on different aspects (his prolific writing and controversial works, the political climate of the 19th century, and his involvement in explosives and arms manufacturing). There is no single overlapping reason that all justifications agree upon to support the claim.
