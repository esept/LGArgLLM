Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first two arguments suggest Cyndi Lauper would use milk substitutes due to her advocacy for animal rights/veganism and health trends, while the third argument contradicts this by stating there is no record of her deviating from traditional dairy use. There is no intersection in meaning across all justifications.
