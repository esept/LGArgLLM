Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first justification incorrectly states that December is closer to January than to July, which does not support the claim. The second justification correctly states that the Southern Hemisphere's winter solstice is in June, which is closer to July, but this contradicts the claim. The third and fourth justifications explain the astronomical reasons for the solstice but do not directly support the claim about the relative closeness to July. Thus, there is no common intersection of justifications supporting the claim.
