Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While most arguments support the claim by highlighting the cold weather and typical behavior of wearing jackets, one argument (the third one) introduces a counterpoint about some children opting for lighter clothing, which contradicts the shared basis of the other arguments. Therefore, there is no common intersection of all justifications.
