Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on the excessive time for uploading with modern plans, the second on the implied upload speed being below capabilities, and the third on the implausibility of slow upload rates for high-tier plans. While all oppose the claim, their justifications address different aspects (time, speed, and plan optimization) without a single shared semantic intersection.
