Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments suggest amoebas could have facilitated the spread of the Black Death by hosting Yersinia pestis, another argument contradicts this by stating there is no direct evidence linking amoebas to the pandemic. The justifications are not consistent in supporting the claim.
