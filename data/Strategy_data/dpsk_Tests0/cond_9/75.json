Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument states that homelessness is impossible due to strict regulations, while the second argues that survival without institutional support is impossible due to logistical challenges. These are distinct reasons and do not intersect semantically to support the claim.
