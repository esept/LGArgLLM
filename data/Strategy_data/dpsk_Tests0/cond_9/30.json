Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While some argue that Latino identity is based on cultural and ethnic heritage (not appearance) and that Latinos can have diverse phenotypes, another justification explicitly states that Sara Paxton does not claim Latin American ancestry, which contradicts the idea that she is considered Latino. There is no shared basis across all justifications to support the claim.
