Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the mechanisms by which anorexia nervosa leads to weakened bones and increased fracture risk. These include malnutrition, hormonal imbalances, low body weight, nutritional deficiencies, and empirical evidence of higher fracture incidence. Each justification supports the claim by highlighting a different aspect of the same underlying cause (bone weakening due to anorexia nervosa), thus forming a coherent and intersecting basis for the claim.
