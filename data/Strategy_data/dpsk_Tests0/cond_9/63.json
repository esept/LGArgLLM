Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. Some argue for thematic similarities between 'Pinocchio' and prophet stories (e.g., character being swallowed by a large creature, moral lessons, transformative journeys), while others argue against direct influence (e.g., Disney's known sources being fairy tales, lack of documented evidence). The arguments are not aligned in supporting the same basis for the claim.
