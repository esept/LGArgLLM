Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Both arguments actually oppose the claim by stating that Christmas trees are not deciduous (they are coniferous and retain needles, unlike deciduous trees that shed leaves). There is no intersection in justifications that supports the claim.
