Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first and third arguments suggest that Thomas Greenhill's parents were involved in non-monogamous relationships, while the second argument states there is no verifiable evidence of such relationships. These justifications contradict each other and do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
