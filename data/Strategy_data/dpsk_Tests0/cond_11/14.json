Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide comprehensive justifications that cover the minimal semantic bases required to support the claim. For instance, the availability of ample water surfaces (long coastline), suitable weather conditions (warm weather), and calm waters (lakes and reservoirs) are all essential factors that make Morocco an ideal location for water skiing. These justifications encompass the necessary support for the claim, even though there are also counterarguments (rough coastal waters) and limitations (less developed infrastructure, fewer facilities). The presence of these supporting P-type arguments satisfies C11.
