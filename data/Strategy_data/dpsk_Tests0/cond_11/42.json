Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that suggest amoebas could have played a role in the Black Death by hosting or protecting Yersinia pestis, but none of these justifications contain the minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments, which argue against amoeba involvement based on transmission dynamics and genetic/historical records. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
