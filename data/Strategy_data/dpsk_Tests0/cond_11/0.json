Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on the potential for injury due to the size, weight, and force of a jackfruit, as well as a scenario where minimal force might not cause injury. However, the S-type arguments introduce additional factors (hard, spiky exterior and irregular shape/density) that are not fully covered by the justifications of the P-type arguments. Thus, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments.
