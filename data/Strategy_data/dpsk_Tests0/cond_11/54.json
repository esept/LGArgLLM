Result: false  
Justification: The claim is about Aretha Franklin's ability to vote for a president when her second child was born. The P-type arguments suggest possibilities (e.g., local elections, jurisdictions with lower voting ages), but none of their justifications contain the minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, which clearly state that the voting age for federal elections (including presidential elections) was 21 in 1960, and Aretha Franklin was only 18. Thus, the P-type arguments do not cover the minimal semantic basis that directly contradicts the claim.
