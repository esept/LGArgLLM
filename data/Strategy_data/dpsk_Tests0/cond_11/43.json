Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification includes the semantic basis that Venus, the densest terrestrial planet, is traditionally linked to Friday, which supports the claim. The S-type arguments do not contradict this basis but provide additional context, which does not negate the minimal semantic support provided by the P-type arguments. Thus, C11 is satisfied.
