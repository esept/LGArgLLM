Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim by mentioning the feasibility of transporting small primates in backpacks under certain conditions (size, ventilation, short-term use). However, the S-type arguments introduce considerations (stress, legal restrictions) that are not semantic subsets of the P-type justifications and instead oppose the claim. Therefore, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments' justifications.
