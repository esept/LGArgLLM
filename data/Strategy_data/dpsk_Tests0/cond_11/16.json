Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that the Toyota Stadium's seating capacity is close to 10% of Gothenburg's population under certain conditions (e.g., considering the urban core population). However, the S-type arguments contradict the claim by stating that the stadium's capacity is significantly lower than 10% of Gothenburg's population when considering the entire metropolitan area. There is no P-type argument whose justification contains the minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments that support the claim, as the S-type arguments actually undermine the claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
