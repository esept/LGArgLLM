Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide reasons why the boy might pray to Pan, but none of the S-type arguments support the claim. Instead, the S-type arguments oppose the claim by suggesting that praying to Pan would not align with the moral lesson, would be unnecessary, or would be culturally inconsistent. Therefore, there is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of a P-type argument's justification and contributes to supporting the claim. C11 is not satisfied.
