Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not fully cover the minimal semantic bases provided by the S-type arguments. Specifically, the S-type arguments emphasize the fictional nature of Cthulhu and the lack of academic recognition, which are not fully addressed or contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments. The P-type arguments focus on the absence of historical evidence and a hypothetical link to ancient texts, but these do not encompass the foundational points made by the S-type arguments about Cthulhu's fictional status and academic irrelevance. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
