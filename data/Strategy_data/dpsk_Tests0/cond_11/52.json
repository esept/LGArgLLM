Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on the non-lethal nature of French Toast and the lack of a mechanism for it to harm a Lannister. However, the S-type arguments provide a different basis for the claim by highlighting the fictional nature of Lannisters and the impossibility of interaction between fictional characters and real-world objects. The justifications of the P-type arguments do not contain the semantic subsets provided by the S-type arguments, which are crucial for supporting the claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
