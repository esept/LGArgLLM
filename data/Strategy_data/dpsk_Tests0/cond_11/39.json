Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not fully encompass the minimal semantic bases provided by the S-type arguments. Specifically, the S-type arguments emphasize the lack of empirical evidence and the secular nature of the Common Era, which are not fully addressed or contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
