Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications about honorary knighthoods awarded by foreign monarchies to American citizens, but none of them address the minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, which state that the U.S. does not have an official system of knighthood and that such titles are unconstitutional under domestic law. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
