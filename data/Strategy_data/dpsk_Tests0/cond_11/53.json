Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide general reasons why Alfred Nobel might have written a banned book, but none of their justifications contain or are semantically equivalent to the minimal support provided by the S-type arguments, which directly refute the claim by pointing to the lack of evidence. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
