Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications related to the box office success of King Kong (2005) and Naomi Watts' prominence, but none of them explicitly state that King Kong was her biggest box office role. The S-type arguments mention other films (The Ring, The Impossible) that could rival or surpass King Kong in terms of box office or impact, suggesting that the claim may not hold for all minimal semantic bases. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
