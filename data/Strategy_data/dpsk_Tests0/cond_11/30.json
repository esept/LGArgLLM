Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification encompasses the semantic content of the S-type arguments. For example, the S-type argument about Sara Paxton's public records not indicating Latino heritage is a subset of the P-type argument that Latino identity is based on cultural and ethnic heritage, not appearance. Similarly, the S-type argument about public perception aligns with the P-type argument that the term 'Latino' refers to people from Latin America or with Latin American ancestry, which Sara Paxton does not claim. Thus, all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments.
