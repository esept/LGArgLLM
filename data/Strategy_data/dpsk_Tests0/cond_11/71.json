Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains a semantic subset that aligns with the support arguments (S-type). For example, the first P argument's justification about modern fiber-optic or high-speed internet plans being designed for faster data transfer is supported by the S argument stating CenturyLink's maximum internet plan offers 940 Mbps upload speeds. Similarly, the second P argument's justification about the implausibly slow upload rate is directly addressed by the S argument comparing the actual upload speed to the claimed rate. The third P argument's justification about consumer internet plans being optimized for high-speed usage is also covered by the S arguments discussing CenturyLink's advertised speeds. Thus, all minimal semantic bases of the claim are contained within the P-type arguments' justifications.
