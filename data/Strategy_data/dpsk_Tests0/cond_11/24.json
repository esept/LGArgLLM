Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on observable aspects of grief (suppression, symptoms, and disorder patterns), but none of their justifications fully contain the minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments, which emphasize non-observable or culturally masked grief. Thus, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments.
