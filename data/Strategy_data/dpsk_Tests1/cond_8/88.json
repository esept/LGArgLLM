Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that Lolcats are fictional or digital entities that do not require physical sustenance, making purchasing food for them unnecessary. The first two arguments directly state that Lolcats cannot consume food due to their fictional nature, while the third argument builds on this by suggesting that resources should instead be allocated to tangible needs, implicitly acknowledging the fictional nature of Lolcats.
