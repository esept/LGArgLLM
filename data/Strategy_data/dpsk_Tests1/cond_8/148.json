Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that HIV cannot be transmitted through sharing silverware, as the virus does not survive outside the body, is not spread through saliva, and requires direct exchange of specific bodily fluids. Each justification reinforces this central point with slightly different emphases (e.g., CDC guidelines, scientific consensus, public health guidelines), but all overlap semantically in supporting the claim.
