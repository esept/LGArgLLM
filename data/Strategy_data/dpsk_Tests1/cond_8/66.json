Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Christopher Columbus, an Italian explorer, named Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Each justification either directly states this or provides supporting historical evidence (e.g., records, voyages, or general acceptance by historians) that reinforces this central point. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in their support for the claim.
