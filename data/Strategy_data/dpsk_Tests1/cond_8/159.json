Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications, as they all compare the size and storage requirements of the Library of Alexandria and the Library of Congress. Common themes include the difference in the number of items (scrolls vs. modern items), the physical dimensions of storage media (scrolls vs. books/digital media), and the diversity of formats (text-based scrolls vs. maps, recordings, etc.). These overlapping ideas consistently support the claim that the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space.
