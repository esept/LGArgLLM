Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that Ronda Rousey's dietary habits or preferences (either publicly stated or related to her training) lead her to avoid BBQ restaurants. The first argument mentions her stated dietary preferences excluding certain foods common at BBQ restaurants, while the second argument mentions her strict training diet not aligning with high-calorie meals at BBQ restaurants. Both justifications revolve around her dietary choices in relation to BBQ restaurants, indicating semantic overlap.
