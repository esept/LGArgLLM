Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim, which is the comparison of the number of hands required to wield Gladiator's weapons versus Faust in Soul Calibur. Each argument either discusses the one-handed nature of Gladiator's weapons (e.g., gladius, scutum, net) or the two-handed nature of Faust (e.g., size, weight, moveset), directly supporting the claim. The overlap in semantic content is consistent across all pairs.
