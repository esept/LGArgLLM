Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications. The first argument focuses on the general study of ancient writing systems potentially including Cthulhu-related texts, while the second argument specifically discusses the hypothetical discovery of such texts and their interpretation. There is no semantic overlap in their justifications beyond the very broad connection to paleography and Cthulhu.
