Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the War Doctor's screen time in the feature-length 50th-anniversary special, while the second argument discusses his inclusion in extended media like novels and audio dramas. These are distinct points that do not intersect in meaning or reasoning pattern.
