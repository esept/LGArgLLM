Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly states or implies that Ada Lovelace died at an age significantly below the average life expectancy for her era, and that her death was considered premature or tragic. The common themes include her age at death (36), the average life expectancy of the time (40-50 years), and the societal or historical view of her death as untimely. These overlapping ideas ensure that every pair of arguments shares at least one common proposition or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
