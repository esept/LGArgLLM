Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that Homer Simpson has four fingers per hand, which necessitates using both hands to count to five. The first argument explains why one hand is insufficient, the second describes how two hands can be used to reach five, and the third reinforces the premise that Homer has only four fingers per hand. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
