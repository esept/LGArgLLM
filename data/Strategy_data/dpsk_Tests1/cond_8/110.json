Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument suggests that Gauss's exceptional cognitive abilities might imply a unique brain structure, while the second argues that Gauss's brain could be considered normal due to the wide range of variability in brain structures. These justifications do not intersect in meaning or reasoning pattern regarding the claim.
