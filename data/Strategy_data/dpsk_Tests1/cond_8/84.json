Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that quadrupeds are represented in the Chinese zodiac. Each argument specifically mentions a different quadruped (Dog, Ox, Horse, Goat, Pig, Tiger) and their inclusion in the Chinese zodiac, along with their symbolic meanings. This overlapping idea of quadrupeds being part of the Chinese zodiac cycle is present in every pair of arguments.
