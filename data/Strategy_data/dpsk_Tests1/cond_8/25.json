Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument revolves around the idea that Boris Johnson is a British politician who has never been a candidate in U.S. elections, making it impossible for San Antonio citizens to vote for him. The justifications consistently emphasize the geographical and electoral system differences between the U.S. and the UK, as well as the absence of Boris Johnson on any U.S. ballots. This common reasoning ensures that every pair of arguments intersects semantically.
