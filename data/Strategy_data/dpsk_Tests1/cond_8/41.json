Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses the small size of the cubs (200-450 grams), the second argument provides the dimensions of a king-size bed (76x80 inches), and the third argument reiterates the cubs' small and compact bodies. All three arguments converge on the idea that the cubs are small enough to fit on a large surface (the king-size bed), thus supporting the claim.
