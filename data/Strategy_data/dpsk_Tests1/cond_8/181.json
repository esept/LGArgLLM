Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share common semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses Curiosity's capabilities or mission objectives that directly support its ability to take samples from Lacus Temporis. For example, the first and third arguments both mention Curiosity's capability to collect rock samples, while the second and fourth arguments discuss the scientific significance and onboard instruments that support the sample collection process. Thus, all pairs overlap in their reasoning.
