Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that radioactive waste is used as a plot device in various types of shows (science fiction, post-apocalyptic, superhero narratives, crime dramas, documentary-style, and children's cartoons). Each justification highlights how radioactive waste serves a specific narrative purpose, such as creating mutations, explaining environmental devastation, or heightening tension, which collectively support the claim. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in their justifications regarding the use of radioactive waste as a plot device.
