Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the French Defense is a well-known, classical, and frequently studied opening in chess, which is why most grandmasters are likely to know it. Each justification reinforces this central theme, whether by mentioning its prevalence in high-level tournaments, its inclusion in chess literature and training materials, or its strategic importance. Thus, there is semantic overlap in all pairs of justifications.
