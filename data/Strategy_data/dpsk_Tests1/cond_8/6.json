Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument focuses on the physical dimensions, structural limitations, or biological characteristics of a swan that make it impossible to fit into a Nike shoebox. For example, arguments about the shoebox's size (length, width, height) overlap with arguments about the swan's wingspan or body shape. Similarly, arguments about the shoebox's structural capacity overlap with arguments about the swan's weight. Thus, every pair of arguments has at least one common idea supporting the claim.
