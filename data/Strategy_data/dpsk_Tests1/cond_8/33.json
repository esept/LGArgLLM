Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim that bodies move during hanging. Each argument discusses a different physiological or physical mechanism (muscle spasms, force of the drop, convulsions, weight distribution) that causes movement, but all are unified by the overarching idea that hanging induces motion in the body. Thus, there is semantic overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim.
