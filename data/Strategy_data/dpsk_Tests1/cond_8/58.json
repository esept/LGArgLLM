Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to Pan's role as a deity relevant to shepherds and the boy's situation. The first and second arguments overlap in discussing Pan's connection to shepherds and the boy's behavior. The first and third arguments both mention Pan's protective role for shepherds. The second and third arguments connect Pan's characteristics (wildness, unpredictability, and protection) to the boy's actions and potential redemption.
