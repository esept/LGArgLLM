Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the Bactrian camel is unique or impressive due to its two humps, which no other animal possesses. Each argument reinforces this central idea, either by stating its uniqueness, comparing it to other animals, or explaining the functional advantage of the two humps. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their semantic justifications with respect to the claim.
