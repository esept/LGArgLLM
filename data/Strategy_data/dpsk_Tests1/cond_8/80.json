Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share overlapping themes related to the inadequacy of the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena for hosting Coachella (e.g., capacity, infrastructure, and technical capabilities), the argument about the arena being demolished in 2016 does not semantically overlap with the others. This argument introduces a temporal limitation that is distinct from the other justifications, which focus on the arena's physical and logistical shortcomings. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification.
