Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea of characters from 'The Book of Mormon' being missionaries, which directly supports the claim. Each argument mentions different characters (Elder Price, Elder Cunningham, Elder McKinley) or aspects of the musical that highlight missionary work, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
