Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first and second arguments both highlight Cheb Mami's musical talent and innovation, which could be recognized by the Pulitzer Prize board. The second and third arguments both emphasize the openness of the Pulitzer Prize to diverse musical styles, which could include Cheb Mami's work. The first and third arguments both suggest that Cheb Mami's unique contributions to music could be considered for the prize. Thus, every pair of arguments has at least one common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
