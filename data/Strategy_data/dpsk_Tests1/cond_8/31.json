Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the University of Pittsburgh's admissions process is less selective and less rigorous than the FBI's hiring process. Each justification highlights different aspects of this comparison (e.g., acceptance rates, evaluation criteria, process complexity, and number of positions available), but all ultimately support the claim by emphasizing the relative ease of entering the university compared to the FBI.
