Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the feasibility of transporting primates in backpacks by highlighting specific aspects such as the size and weight of small primates, the availability of specialized backpacks, the use of backpacks by wildlife rescue organizations, and the safety features of backpacks. These justifications collectively support the claim by addressing different but related facets of the same central idea.
