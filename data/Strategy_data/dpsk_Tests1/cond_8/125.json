Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references the geographical overlap between grey seals and sperm whales (the subject of 'Moby Dick') in the North Atlantic Ocean, either through habitat, migratory patterns, or historical observations. This common idea supports the claim that they can swim in the same water.
