Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly states or implies that Kurt Sutter and his collaborators were not involved in 'Beauty and the Beast' adaptations, either due to lack of evidence, contrasting creative styles, or well-documented production histories. The common idea across all justifications is the absence of Sutter's involvement in these adaptations.
