```
Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that barley is essential for beer production, which is directly related to the claim about the owners needing barley. The first argument explicitly mentions barley as a key ingredient in beer production at the Pawtucket Brewery, while the second argument reinforces this by stating that barley is a staple crop for breweries. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
