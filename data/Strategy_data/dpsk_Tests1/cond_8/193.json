Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the financial burden caused by pancreas removal. The common themes include high medical costs (A1, A2, A4, A5), ongoing expenses for chronic conditions (A2, A4, A5), loss of income (A3), and insurance-related financial strain (A1, A4, A5). These intersections ensure that every pair of arguments has at least one shared idea supporting the claim.
