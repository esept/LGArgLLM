Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the differences in color patterns between the giant panda and the yin yang symbol. Each argument highlights a distinct aspect of this difference (e.g., localization of colors, symmetry, presence of dots, proportion of colors), but all are grounded in comparing the panda's coloration to the yin yang symbol. Thus, they overlap in their core focus on contrasting the two subjects' color schemes.
