Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss System of a Down's opposition to political systems (war and military-industrial complexes in the first, national identity and genocide recognition in the second), which can be linked to anti-globalization. The first and third arguments both address cultural critiques (political systems in the first, cultural preservation in the third), which are often tied to anti-globalization. The second and third arguments both focus on themes of national identity and cultural preservation, which are central to critiques of globalization.
