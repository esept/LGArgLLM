Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first and second arguments both relate to the technological capabilities and context of Heaven's Gate (JPEG being widely available and the group's use of technology). The first and third arguments both address the accessibility of JPEG (widely available and not requiring specialized knowledge). The second and third arguments both relate to the leader's ability to use technology (general use of technology and accessibility of JPEG).
