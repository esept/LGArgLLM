Result: false
Justification: While many arguments share overlapping themes (e.g., robustness of northern fur seals, established veterinary protocols, and timing in July), not all pairs necessarily share a direct semantic intersection in their justifications. For example, the argument about "modern veterinary facilities having advanced monitoring equipment" does not directly overlap with the argument about "July falling within the non-breeding season," as they address different aspects (equipment vs. seasonal timing). Thus, not all pairs share a common justification.
