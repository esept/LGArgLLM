Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that watermelon is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction in people with a tricarboxylic acid allergy. The first argument states this directly by mentioning the absence of significant amounts of tricarboxylic acids in watermelon, while the second argument supports this by noting the lack of documented cases in medical literature. Both justifications converge on the safety of watermelon for this specific allergy.
