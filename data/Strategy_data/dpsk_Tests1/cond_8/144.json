Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that 'muspi merol' (the backwards version of 'Lorem ipsum') lacks repeated initial consonant sounds, which is a necessary condition for alliteration. Each justification reinforces this point by either stating the absence of repeated sounds or explaining the requirement for alliteration, thus overlapping semantically in relation to the claim.
