```
Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss the scarcity of BLTs due to cultural or ingredient-related reasons (non-traditional dish and difficulty sourcing bacon). The first and third arguments both mention the lack of demand or availability due to local preferences and non-traditional status. The second and third arguments both touch on the cultural or dietary reasons (bacon sourcing and local preferences) that make BLTs hard to find in Casablanca.
