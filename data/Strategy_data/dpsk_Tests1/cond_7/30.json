Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and fourth arguments both reference the definition of Latino heritage, and the second and fourth arguments both discuss the inclusivity of the term 'Latino'. Therefore, there is overlap in their semantic contributions to the claim.
