Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint as they all relate to the use of biochemistry in various subfields of geography (environmental geography, human-environment interactions, past climate reconstruction, urban geography, and biogeography). Each justification provides a distinct but related application of biochemistry in geography, contributing to the overall support of the claim.
