Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the higher acceptance rate of the University of Pittsburgh compared to the FBI's selective hiring process (A1, A5) or the rigorous and multi-stage nature of the FBI's process compared to the simpler admissions process of the university (A2, A3, A4). These overlaps mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
