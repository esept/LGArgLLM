Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct example or context (e.g., science fiction, post-apocalyptic, superhero narratives, crime dramas, documentary-style shows, children's cartoons) where radioactive waste is used as a plot device, without overlapping in their specific semantic contributions to the claim.
