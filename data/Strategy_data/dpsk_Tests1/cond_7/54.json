Result: true
Justification: The two arguments are not semantically disjoint because both justifications relate to the same underlying point: that Aretha Franklin was eligible to vote in the 1960 presidential election when her second child was born. The first justification establishes her general eligibility, while the second specifies the timing of the election relative to her child's birth. Since they share a common semantic subset (her eligibility to vote in 1960), they are not disjoint.
