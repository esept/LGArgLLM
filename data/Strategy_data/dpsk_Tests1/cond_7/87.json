Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that lemonade contains Vitamin C, either by mentioning lemons as a source of Vitamin C, the presence of Vitamin C in liquid form, the measurable amount in a standard glass, or nutritional analyses confirming its presence. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
