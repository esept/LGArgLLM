Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., general health of fur seals, established protocols, non-breeding season, advanced equipment, prior success, and emergency protocols). None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
