Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the lack of tradition for BLTs in Moroccan cuisine, the second on the difficulty of sourcing specific ingredients like bacon, and the third on local preferences limiting demand. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
