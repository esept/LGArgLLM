Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to Bill Gates' wealth and financial standing compared to other Baby Boomers. The justifications overlap in discussing his net worth, the success of Microsoft, his investments, and public rankings, all contributing to the claim that he is the wealthiest of the Baby Boomers. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
