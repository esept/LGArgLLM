Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic theme related to the size of the cubs and the dimensions of the bed, contributing to the support of the claim. For example, the first argument mentions the small size of the cubs, the second mentions the large size of the bed, and the third combines these ideas by stating the cubs can fit side by side without overlapping. Thus, there is overlap in meaning among the justifications.
