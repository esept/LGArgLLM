Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on Gauss's exceptional cognitive abilities implying a unique brain structure, while the second justification discusses the wide range of 'normal' brain structures, making it plausible Gauss's brain fell within this range. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
