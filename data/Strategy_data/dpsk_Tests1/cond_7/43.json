Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the association of Friday with Venus in astrology, while the second justification discusses planetary density as a symbolic factor in some traditions. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
