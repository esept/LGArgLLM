Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct example of a space mission with fatalities (Apollo 1, Space Shuttle Columbia, Soyuz 11, and Challenger/Columbia in public memory), all of which are separate incidents that eclipse the Apollo 13 mission in terms of fatalities. There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications; each argument stands alone as a unique supporting point for the claim.
