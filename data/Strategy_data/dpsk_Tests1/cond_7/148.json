Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the claim that HIV cannot be transmitted through sharing silverware. They all refer to the inability of HIV to survive outside the human body, the lack of transmission via saliva, and the scientific consensus on this matter. Therefore, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
