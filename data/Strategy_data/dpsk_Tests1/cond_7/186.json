Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that potato vodka is made from gluten-free ingredients (potatoes) and that this makes it safe for individuals with celiac disease. Additionally, several arguments reference the absence of gluten in potato vodka due to the distillation process or the nature of the ingredients. These overlapping themes mean that the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
