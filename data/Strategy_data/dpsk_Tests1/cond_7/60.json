Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the box office performance of King Kong (2005) and its comparison to other films in Naomi Watts' career, while the second argument highlights the critical acclaim but lack of box office success of Mulholland Drive (2001). These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
