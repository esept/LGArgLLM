Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the historical rarity and expense of ultramarine blue due to lapis lazuli, while the second argument discusses the cost of synthetic blue pigments like cobalt blue and cerulean blue due to raw materials and manufacturing. There is no overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim.
