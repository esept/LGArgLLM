Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on amoebas harboring Yersinia pestis, the second on their survival in harsh environments, and the third on laboratory evidence of Yersinia pestis survival inside amoebas. These points do not overlap in meaning.
