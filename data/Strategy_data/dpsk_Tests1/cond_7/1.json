Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing different but complementary reasons supporting the idea that the leader of Heaven's Gate could save images in JPEG format. The first justification mentions the widespread availability of JPEG, the second points out the group's use of technology, and the third emphasizes the accessibility of the format. Together, they form a coherent set of reasons supporting the claim.
