Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all describe different aspects of how anatomical and symbolic hearts differ in appearance and representation. Each argument focuses on a distinct feature (e.g., structure, color, symmetry, usage), and there is no semantic overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim. Therefore, all pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint.
