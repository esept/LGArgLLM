Result: true
Justification: Each argument provides a distinct example of a quadruped (Dog, Ox, Horse, Goat, Pig, Tiger) represented in the Chinese zodiac. While all justifications support the claim by listing different quadrupeds, they do not share a common semantic subset beyond the general idea that quadrupeds are represented. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
