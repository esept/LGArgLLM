Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the low budget and high box office returns of "Easy Rider" (e.g., A1 and A2), as well as its cultural impact and longevity in theaters (e.g., A3 and A4). These justifications share common themes that contribute to the support of the claim, so they are not semantically disjoint.
