Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic theme of using olive oil and water for bathing or soaking, either for historical, therapeutic, or skincare reasons. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to supporting the claim by overlapping in their focus on the practice of soaking in olive oil and water.
