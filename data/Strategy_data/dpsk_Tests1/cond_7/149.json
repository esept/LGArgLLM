Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why an ammonia fighting cleaner is good for pet owners (e.g., neutralizing odors, breaking down stains, disinfecting, deterring re-soiling, affordability, and safety on non-porous surfaces). None of the justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in meaning while supporting the claim.
