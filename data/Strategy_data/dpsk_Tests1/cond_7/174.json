Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on Ronda Rousey's publicly stated dietary preferences excluding certain foods, while the second argument emphasizes her strict training diet not aligning with high-calorie meals. These justifications address different aspects of her dietary habits without overlapping in meaning with respect to the claim.
