Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim because each argument cites a different foreign or religious order (e.g., British Order of the British Empire, Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, Order of Saint John, Order of Saint Lazarus) that confers knighthoods on Americans. While all support the claim, they do so by referencing distinct organizations and criteria, with no overlap in their justifications.
