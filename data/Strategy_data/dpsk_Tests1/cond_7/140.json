Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all revolve around the same core idea: Homer Simpson's inability to count to five with one hand due to having only four fingers per hand, and the necessity of using both hands to achieve the count. The arguments complement each other by providing different aspects of the same reasoning (e.g., the mechanics of counting, the anatomical constraint, and the lack of evidence for additional fingers).
