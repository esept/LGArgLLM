Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic theme related to how anorexia nervosa negatively impacts bone health, leading to increased fracture risk. While each argument highlights a different aspect (e.g., malnutrition, hormonal imbalances, low body weight, deficiencies in nutrients, low estrogen levels, osteoporosis, reduced physical activity), they all contribute to the same overarching idea that anorexia nervosa increases the likelihood of bone fractures. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
