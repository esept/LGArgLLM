Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to Curiosity's capabilities and mission objectives. For example, all arguments mention Curiosity's ability to collect or analyze samples, and some specifically reference its equipment or past successes. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
