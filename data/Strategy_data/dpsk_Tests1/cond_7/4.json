Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim because each argument provides a distinct example of a Small Solar System body named after a different mythical creature (e.g., Ceres, Pluto, Eros, Chiron, Haumea). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications as each refers to a unique mythical figure and celestial body.
