Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the large number of participating athletes increasing the likelihood of mutual attraction, while the second argument emphasizes the close bonds formed due to shared experiences. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
