Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Downey Jr.'s recovery and redemption, the second on his talent and dedication, and the third on his philanthropic efforts and advocacy. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
