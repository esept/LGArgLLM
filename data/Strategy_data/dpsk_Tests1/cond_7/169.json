Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they address distinct reasons why Quiet would be a poor lecturer (lack of credentials, irrelevant skills, inability to speak, ethical misalignment, and lack of teaching experience). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
