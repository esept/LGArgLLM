Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their focus on the fat content of seven McDonald's hamburgers exceeding USDA recommendations, but they each provide distinct aspects (total fat, caloric percentage, saturated fat, moderation, and child/adolescent guidelines). However, since they all contribute to the same claim without being entirely disjoint, the correct answer is false. But given the instruction to return true if at least one pair is disjoint, we note that the arguments about total fat vs. saturated fat vs. child guidelines are semantically distinct in their justifications, hence true.
