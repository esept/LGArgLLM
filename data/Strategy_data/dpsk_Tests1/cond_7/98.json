Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the War Doctor's screen time in the feature-length episode, while the second argument discusses his inclusion in extended media like novels and audio dramas, which are not directly comparable to screen time in the show. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
