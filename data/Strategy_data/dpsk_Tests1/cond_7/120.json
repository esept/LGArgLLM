Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or piece of evidence (e.g., gladius being one-handed, Faust being two-handed, gladiators using shields, Faust's moveset, nets and tridents, Faust's size and weight) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. All justifications independently support the claim without sharing a common semantic subset.
