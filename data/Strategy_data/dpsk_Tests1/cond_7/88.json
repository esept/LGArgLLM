Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the fictional nature of Lolcats, the second on the impracticality of feeding a digital entity, and the third on the opportunity cost of resources. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
