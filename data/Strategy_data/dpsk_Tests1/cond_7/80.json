Let's analyze the justifications for each pair of arguments to determine if at least one pair is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

1. Argument 1 (capacity) vs Argument 2 (outdoor space): These address different aspects (size vs. space type) - disjoint.
2. Argument 1 vs Argument 3 (infrastructure): Different aspects (capacity vs. facilities) - disjoint.
3. Argument 1 vs Argument 4 (demolition): Different aspects (capacity vs. existence) - disjoint.
4. Argument 1 vs Argument 5 (technical capabilities): Different aspects (capacity vs. production) - disjoint.
5. Argument 2 vs Argument 3: Both relate to space/facilities but address different specific needs (stages vs. parking) - could be considered overlapping in general facility inadequacy.
6. Argument 2 vs Argument 4: Different aspects (space type vs. existence) - disjoint.
7. Argument 2 vs Argument 5: Different aspects (space vs. production) - disjoint.
8. Argument 3 vs Argument 4: Different aspects (facilities vs. existence) - disjoint.
9. Argument 3 vs Argument 5: Different aspects (facilities vs. production) - disjoint.
10. Argument 4 vs Argument 5: Different aspects (existence vs. production) - disjoint.

Several pairs (e.g., any involving Argument 4 about demolition) are clearly disjoint from others as they address fundamentally different reasons for inadequacy.

```
Result: true
Justification: Multiple argument pairs have semantically disjoint justifications, particularly those involving the Arena's demolition (Argument 4) which is unrelated to capacity or facility limitations addressed by other arguments.
