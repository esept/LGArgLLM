Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the negative resonance of substance abuse themes, while another highlights the potential for the show to serve as a coping mechanism. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
