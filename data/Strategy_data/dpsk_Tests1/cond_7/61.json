Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., lightweight primates fitting in backpacks, specialized pet carriers, wildlife rescue practices, and secure backpack features). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
