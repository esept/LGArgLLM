Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on language barriers (e.g., understanding French menus or directions), while the second argument addresses cultural differences in service or communication styles. These are distinct reasons contributing to the claim, with no overlap in meaning.
