Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to Christopher Columbus, an Italian explorer, naming Saint Vincent and the Grenadines during his voyages. The justifications overlap in their support of the claim by referencing Columbus's role and historical documentation, so no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
