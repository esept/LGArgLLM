Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments cover distinct aspects of how music can be used as a weapon, such as physical effects (e.g., hearing damage, disorientation), psychological manipulation (e.g., breaking down resistance, inducing stress), historical uses (e.g., intimidation, morale boosting), and modern applications (e.g., crowd control, propaganda). There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications with respect to supporting the claim. Each argument presents a unique way in which music can be weaponized.
