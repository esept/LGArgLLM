Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the VLT's capabilities (resolution, adaptive optics, aperture) and the observability of large terrestrial features like Mount Everest. For example, multiple arguments mention the VLT's resolution and adaptive optics, which are overlapping justifications supporting the claim. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
