Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the combined physical dimensions of all three wives fitting into the Audi TT, while the second argument considers the average body sizes of the wives individually. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
