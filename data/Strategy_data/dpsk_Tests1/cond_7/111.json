Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., historical context, accessibility, lack of impairments, personal adaptability) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
