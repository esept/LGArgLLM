Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic theme that February in New York is cold, necessitating jackets for school children. There is significant overlap in meaning across all pairs of arguments, as they all refer to the cold weather in February and the need for jackets. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
