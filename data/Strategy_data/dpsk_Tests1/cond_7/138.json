Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content regarding the dangers of consuming chlorine and sodium. For example, multiple arguments mention the toxic and harmful effects of sodium metal (e.g., chemical burns, violent reactions with water) and the dangers of chlorine gas (e.g., respiratory irritation, toxic fumes). Since these justifications share common themes contributing to the claim, none of the pairs are semantically disjoint.
