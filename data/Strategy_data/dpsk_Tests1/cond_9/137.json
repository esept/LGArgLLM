Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core of using biochemistry to analyze environmental or biological samples (soil, water, ice cores, plant/animal tissues) for various geographical studies (nutrient cycles, pollution, climate reconstruction, contamination, ecosystem dynamics). This consistently supports the claim that a geographer would use biochemistry in their work.
