Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core supporting the claim that northern fur seals are likely safe anesthesia candidates for emergency surgery in July. They collectively emphasize the seals' physiological robustness, established veterinary protocols, favorable seasonal conditions (non-breeding), advanced monitoring capabilities, prior successful cases, and emergency-specific risk mitigation. Each justification reinforces the safety and feasibility of anesthesia in this context.
