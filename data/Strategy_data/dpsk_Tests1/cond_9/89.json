Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that the Very Large Telescope (VLT) has the technical capabilities (resolution, adaptive optics, aperture, etc.) to observe large terrestrial features like the largest mountain on Earth (Mount Everest). Each argument reinforces this core idea with specific details about the VLT's technology or the mountain's detectability.
