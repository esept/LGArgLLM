Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that the duration of Borgia's World of Wonders is shorter than Ludacris's Release Therapy, making it possible to watch the former before the latter finishes. The arguments differ slightly in phrasing (e.g., "shorter production," "brief show," "slower speed"), but all support the same underlying reasoning.
