Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. While they all support the claim that the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena was inadequate for hosting Coachella, they do so based on different reasons (capacity, space, infrastructure, demolition, and technical capabilities). There is no single overlapping justification that all arguments rely on.
