Result: true  
Justification: Both justifications share a common semantic core related to Ronda Rousey's dietary preferences and restrictions, which lead her to avoid BBQ restaurants. The first justification mentions her publicly stated dietary preferences excluding certain foods, while the second points to her strict training diet not aligning with high-calorie meals. Both support the claim by indicating her avoidance of BBQ restaurants due to dietary reasons.
