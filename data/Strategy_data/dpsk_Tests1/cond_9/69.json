Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that links anorexia nervosa to increased bone fragility and fracture risk through various mechanisms (e.g., bone density loss, malnutrition, hormonal imbalances, deficiencies in bone-strengthening nutrients, and reduced physical activity).
