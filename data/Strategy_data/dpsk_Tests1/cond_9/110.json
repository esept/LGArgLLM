Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first justification suggests Gauss's brain structure might be unique due to his exceptional cognitive abilities, while the second argues that his brain structure could be considered normal due to the wide range of variability in brain structures. These justifications are not aligned in supporting the same semantic basis for the claim.
