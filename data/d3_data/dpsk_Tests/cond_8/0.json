Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the subset relation is transitive, either by definition, by contradiction, or by properties of partial orders. Each argument reinforces the idea that if every element of A is in B and every element of B is in C, then every element of A must be in C, proving A âŠ† C. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in this core reasoning.
