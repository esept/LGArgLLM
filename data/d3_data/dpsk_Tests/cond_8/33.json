Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that Paris is in the Central European Time (CET) zone and that during daylight saving time, the offset from UTC is +2 hours. The first argument states the general offset (UTC+1 standard, UTC+2 DST), while the second argument specifies the period of daylight saving time (last Sunday in March to last Sunday in October). Both justifications support the claim by explaining the time difference between UTC and Paris during daylight saving time.
