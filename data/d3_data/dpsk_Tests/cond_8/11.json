Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that central banks use interest rates as a tool to influence economic factors (such as borrowing costs, savings, spending, and currency value) which in turn affect inflation. Each justification relates to this core concept, albeit from slightly different angles (e.g., demand-pull inflation, economic activity, deflationary pressures, historical data, etc.). Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
