Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the parent's current age is twice the child's current age (40 vs. 20), and the age difference (20 years) implies the parent was 20 at the child's birth. Each justification either states this directly or derives it through subtraction or mathematical consistency, creating semantic overlap in all pairs.
