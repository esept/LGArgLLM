Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that Newtonâ€™s third law of motion (action-reaction principle) explains the generation of lift in airplanes. Each argument explicitly or implicitly references the downward deflection of air by the wings and the resulting upward reaction force (lift), which is the core idea linking all justifications to the claim. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in this fundamental reasoning.
