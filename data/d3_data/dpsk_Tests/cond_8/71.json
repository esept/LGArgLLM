Result: true
Justification: All arguments share a common semantic justification related to the transitive property or syllogism in logic. Each argument either directly references the transitive property, the implication chain, the syllogism pattern, or the hypothetical syllogism rule, all of which are fundamentally the same idea in this context. Therefore, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justification with respect to the claim.
