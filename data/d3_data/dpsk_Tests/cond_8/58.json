Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses aspects of genetic similarity between humans and chimpanzees, such as coding DNA sequences, phylogenetic relationships, functional gene similarity, evolutionary divergence time, protein-coding genes, and regulatory regions. These justifications collectively support the claim by highlighting different facets of the high DNA similarity between the two species.
