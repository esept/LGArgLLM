Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument reinforces the idea that the U.S. has a strong track record of meeting its debt obligations, whether through historical records, legal mechanisms, or actions taken during crises. The common theme across all justifications is the U.S.'s consistent ability and willingness to pay its debts, which directly supports the claim.
