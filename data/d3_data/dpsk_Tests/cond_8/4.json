Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that for any real number x, there exists another real number y such that x > y. The justifications vary in their specific constructions of y (e.g., y = x - 1, y = -n - 1, y = x/2 - 1) or general properties of real numbers (e.g., unbounded below, Archimedean property, density), but they all support the claim by demonstrating or implying the existence of such a y. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
