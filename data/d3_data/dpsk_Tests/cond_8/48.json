Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that water's boiling point varies with altitude due to changes in atmospheric pressure. Each argument either directly states this relationship, provides empirical evidence, explains the scientific basis (Clausius-Clapeyron equation), or discusses practical implications (cooking). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in supporting the claim.
