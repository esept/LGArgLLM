Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the square of any real number is non-negative, either through algebraic properties (multiplication rules), specific cases (zero, positive, negative numbers), graphical representation, or fundamental mathematical concepts (real analysis, ordered field properties). Each pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim by reinforcing the non-negativity of squares in different contexts.
