Result: true
Justification: All justifications for the arguments share the common idea that the truth of A is directly implied by the logical conjunction "A and B," either through explicit reference to the premise, the definition of logical AND, or the principle of simplification in logic. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
