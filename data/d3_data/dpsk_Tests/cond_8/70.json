Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the claim is a valid logical deduction based on the premises provided (all dogs bark and Rex does not bark). Each argument either explicitly references modus tollens, universal instantiation, contraposition, or taxonomic classification principles, all of which are logically equivalent in this context. Therefore, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
