Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the claim follows from the logical principle of disjunctive syllogism or elimination in propositional logic. Each argument explicitly or implicitly references the idea that if "A or B" is true and "A" is false, then "B" must be true by necessity, which is the core reasoning pattern supporting the claim. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justification.
