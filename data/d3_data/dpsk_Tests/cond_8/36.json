Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that tsunamis are caused by the displacement of water due to various underwater or near-ocean events (earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions). Each argument either directly states or implies this mechanism, linking it to the claim. For example, the first three arguments explicitly mention water displacement, while the latter three provide historical or scientific evidence supporting the same idea. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in this core reasoning.
