Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that a progressive tax system imposes higher tax rates on higher income earners, either through design principles (ability-to-pay), empirical evidence (OECD data), or policy goals (reducing inequality). The justifications consistently reinforce the claim by overlapping in their core reasoning about progressive taxation.
