Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that if A is necessary for B, then B's occurrence is contingent upon A's presence. This is expressed through definitions, logical necessity, formal logic equivalences, empirical observations, and philosophical principles. The semantic overlap is clear as each justification reinforces the claim by highlighting the dependency of B on A.
