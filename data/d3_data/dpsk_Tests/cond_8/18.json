```
Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that divisibility by 4 inherently implies divisibility by 2, either through expressing 4 as a multiple of 2, using prime factorization, or referencing mathematical definitions of divisibility. Each pair of arguments overlaps in their reasoning about the relationship between 4 and 2 in terms of divisibility.
