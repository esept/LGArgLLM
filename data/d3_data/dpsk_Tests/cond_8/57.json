Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea of the Earth's rotation direction being from west to east, supported by various observational and physical phenomena (Coriolis effect, sunrise/sunset patterns, satellite observations, Foucault pendulum, star trails, and angular momentum). Each pair of arguments intersects in their justifications by referencing different evidence or phenomena that all consistently point to the same rotational direction.
