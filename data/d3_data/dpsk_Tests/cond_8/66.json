Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the claim is a valid logical deduction based on principles like contraposition, subset relationships, universal instantiation, modus tollens, and the law of non-contradiction. Each justification reinforces the same core reasoning that if all A are B, then anything not B cannot be A, ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
