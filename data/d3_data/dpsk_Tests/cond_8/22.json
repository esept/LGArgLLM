Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the statements 'x > y' and 'y < x' are logically equivalent by definition or mathematical properties. Each justification refers to mathematical axioms, definitions, or properties (e.g., symmetry, transitivity) that universally support this equivalence, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair of arguments.
