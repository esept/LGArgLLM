Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the age difference between person A and person B is consistently 20 years, and this difference is used to calculate person A's current age based on person B's current age. The justifications overlap in their reliance on the constant age difference and simple arithmetic to derive the conclusion.
