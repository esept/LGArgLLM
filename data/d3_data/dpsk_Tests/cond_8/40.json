Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. For example, arguments about landmass distribution (A1, A3), highly populated countries (A2, A4), and historical settlement patterns (A5, A6) all intersect in supporting the claim that more people live north of the Equator. Each argument reinforces the others by highlighting different aspects (geography, population density, urbanization) that collectively support the claim.
