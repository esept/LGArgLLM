Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the linear progression of time (as measured by the Gregorian calendar) means a December 1999 birthdate is earlier than a January 2000 birthdate, making the December-born person younger. This core idea is present in every argument's justification, either explicitly or implicitly (e.g., "earlier in time," "precedes," "passage of time," "standard age calculations"). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in supporting the claim.
