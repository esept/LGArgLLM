Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications related to the claim. For example:
- A1 and A2 both discuss how beta-blockers reduce cardiac workload by affecting heart rate and sympathetic activity.
- A3 and A5 both reference clinical evidence (trials and guidelines) supporting the use of beta-blockers in heart failure.
- A4 and A6 both address how beta-blockers reduce factors (blood pressure and arrhythmias) that increase cardiac workload.
Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in some aspect of their justification supporting the claim.
