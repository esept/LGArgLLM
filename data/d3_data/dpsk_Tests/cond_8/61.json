Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that geothermal energy is derived from Earth's internal heat, with justifications focusing on different aspects such as the Earth's core, underground reservoirs, mantle and crust, natural heat flow, and inherent thermal properties. Each pair of arguments overlaps in discussing the source of geothermal energy as Earth's internal heat, albeit through different mechanisms or scientific perspectives.
