Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to Newton’s third law and its application to lift generation in airplanes. Specifically, they all discuss how the downward deflection of air by the wings results in an upward lift force, which is a direct consequence of Newton’s third law. Since none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false.
