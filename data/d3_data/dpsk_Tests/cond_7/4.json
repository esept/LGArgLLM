Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that for any real number x, there exists another real number y such that x > y. They differ only in the specific construction or property used to demonstrate this (e.g., unboundedness, Archimedean property, density), but the core idea supporting the claim is the same across all arguments.
