Given the arguments provided, let's analyze their justifications with respect to the claim.

The claim is: "If itâ€™s 3 PM UTC, it's 4 PM in Paris during daylight saving time."

The two arguments are:
1. A1: "Paris is in the Central European Time (CET) zone, which is UTC+1 during standard time and UTC+2 during daylight saving time."
2. A2: "Daylight saving time in Paris typically runs from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October, during which the local time is UTC+2."

Now, let's examine the justifications:
- A1's justification explains the time difference between UTC and Paris time during standard time and daylight saving time.
- A2's justification provides the specific period during which daylight saving time is observed in Paris and reiterates the UTC+2 offset during that period.

The justifications of A1 and A2 are not semantically disjoint because they both refer to the UTC+2 offset during daylight saving time in Paris, which directly supports the claim. A2 adds more specific information about the duration of daylight saving time, but this is complementary to A1's information rather than disjoint.

Since there are no pairs of arguments with justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is False.

```
Result: false
Justification: Both arguments' justifications refer to the UTC+2 offset during daylight saving time in Paris, which supports the claim, and are thus not semantically disjoint.
