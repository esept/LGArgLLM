Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the U.S. government's consistent ability and legal mechanisms to avoid default on its national debt. None of the pairs of arguments have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each justification reinforces the claim by providing overlapping evidence or reasoning about the U.S. never defaulting on its debt.
