Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the justification for the first argument focuses on reducing heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, while the justification for the second argument focuses on inhibiting sympathetic overactivity and cardiac remodeling. These justifications address different mechanisms by which beta-blockers reduce cardiac workload, and there is no overlap in their semantic content that directly supports the claim. Similarly, other pairs of justifications (e.g., clinical trials vs. lowering blood pressure) also address distinct aspects of the claim without semantic overlap.
