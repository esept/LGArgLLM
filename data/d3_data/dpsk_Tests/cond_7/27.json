Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all arguments share a common semantic subset related to the claim. They all rely on the idea that the process occurs on days that are multiples of 12, and specifically mention or imply that 24 and 36 are such multiples. Therefore, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
