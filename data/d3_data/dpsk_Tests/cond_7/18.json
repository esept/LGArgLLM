Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the mathematical relationship between divisibility by 4 and divisibility by 2. For example, the first and second justifications both rely on the fact that 4 is a multiple of 2, and the third and fourth justifications both reference the prime factorization or general divisibility rules. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
