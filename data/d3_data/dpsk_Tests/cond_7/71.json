Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are semantically overlapping with respect to the claim. They all refer to the transitive property, syllogism, or logical implications, which are different ways of expressing the same underlying principle that supports the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint.
