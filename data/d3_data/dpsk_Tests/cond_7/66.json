Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all refer to logical principles (contraposition, subset relationships, universal instantiation, modus tollens, and the law of non-contradiction) to explain why the claim is valid. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
