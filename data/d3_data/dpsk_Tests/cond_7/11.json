Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss how interest rates affect economic activity (through borrowing costs and savings returns, respectively) to control inflation, indicating some semantic overlap. However, since the task requires that at least one pair is disjoint, we can consider pairs like the third and fourth arguments, where one discusses the effect of lower interest rates on deflation and the other mentions central banks' explicit use of interest rates for inflation targets. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset directly related to the claim, making them disjoint in this context.
