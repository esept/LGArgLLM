Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that geothermal energy is derived from Earth's internal heat. Each argument provides a different perspective or detail about how this internal heat is harnessed or its origins, but they all fundamentally relate to the same core idea. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
