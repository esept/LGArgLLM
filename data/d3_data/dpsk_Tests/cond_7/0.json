Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, namely the idea that the subset relation is transitive. Whether it is through the definition of subsets, the transitive property, or element-wise reasoning, all arguments ultimately rely on the same core concept to justify the claim. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
