Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments share a common semantic subset that supports the claim: they all rely on the relationship between the area of a square and its side length, and then use the side length to calculate the perimeter. Specifically, they all derive the side length as 5 from the area of 25 and then compute the perimeter as 20. Thus, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
