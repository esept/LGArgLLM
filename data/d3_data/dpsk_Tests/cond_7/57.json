Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct piece of evidence (e.g., Coriolis effect, sunrise/sunset patterns, satellite observations, Foucault pendulum, star trails, angular momentum) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning.
