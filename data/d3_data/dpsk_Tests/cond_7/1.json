Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the algebraic property that the product of a real number with itself (or two negatives) is non-negative, and others reference the graphical representation of the function f(x) = xÂ². These overlapping justifications mean that the arguments are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
