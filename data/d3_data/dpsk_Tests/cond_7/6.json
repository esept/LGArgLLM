Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first argument mentions the power of judicial review granted by the constitution, while the fourth argument also refers to constitutions as supreme legal documents, indicating an overlap in their semantic content regarding the constitutional basis for judicial review. Similarly, the second argument cites Marbury v. Madison as establishing judicial review, which is related to the broader principle of judicial review mentioned in other arguments. Therefore, there are overlapping semantic elements among the justifications.
