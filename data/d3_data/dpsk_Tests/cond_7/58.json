Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, the first argument mentions "approximately 98-99% of their coding DNA sequences," while the second argument refers to "the high degree of genetic similarity," which is a broader but related concept. Similarly, the third and fifth arguments discuss functional genes and protein-coding genes, which are subsets of the broader genetic similarity. Therefore, the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
