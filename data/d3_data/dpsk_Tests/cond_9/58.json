Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by highlighting the high degree of genetic similarity between humans and chimpanzees, whether through coding DNA sequences, phylogenetic analyses, functional genes, divergence time, protein-coding genes, or regulatory regions. Each justification reinforces the idea that humans and chimpanzees are genetically very similar, which directly supports the claim.
