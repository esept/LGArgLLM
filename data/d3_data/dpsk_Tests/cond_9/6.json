Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They all revolve around the idea that judicial review is a constitutional power allowing courts to assess and invalidate laws that conflict with constitutional provisions. This is supported by references to constitutional supremacy, separation of powers, historical precedent (Marbury v. Madison), and the protection of individual rights. The overlap in meaning is clear and consistent across all arguments.
