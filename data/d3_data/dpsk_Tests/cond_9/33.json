Result: true  
Justification: Both justifications support the claim by explaining the time difference between UTC and Paris during daylight saving time. The first justification states that Paris is UTC+2 during daylight saving time, and the second justification confirms the time difference and the period when daylight saving time is in effect. Together, they provide a consistent semantic basis for the claim.
