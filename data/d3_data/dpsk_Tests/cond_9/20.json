Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the same semantic core, which is the mathematical relationship between the area and perimeter of a square. They all derive the side length from the area (25 implies side length of 5) and then calculate the perimeter as 4 times the side length (20). The arguments differ only in phrasing but not in the underlying logical or mathematical basis.
