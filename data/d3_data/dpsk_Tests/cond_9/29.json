Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by consistently using the mathematical relationship between the parent's and child's ages to conclude that the parent was 20 when the child was born. Each justification either states the current ages (parent 40, child 20) or derives the age difference (20 years), leading to the same conclusion.
