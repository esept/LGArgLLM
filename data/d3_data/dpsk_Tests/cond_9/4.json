Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that for any real number x, there exists another real number y such that y is less than x. This is supported by various properties of real numbers (unboundedness, Archimedean property, density) and specific constructions of y (e.g., y = x - 1, y = x/2 - 1, y = -n - 1). The justifications collectively reinforce the same underlying mathematical truth.
