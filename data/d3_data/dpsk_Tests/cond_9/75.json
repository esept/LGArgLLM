Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to how beta-blockers reduce cardiac workload in heart failure, either through direct mechanisms (reducing heart rate, blood pressure, arrhythmias) or indirect effects (inhibiting sympathetic overactivity, improving outcomes, following guidelines). The intersection is the reduction of cardiac workload via various physiological and clinical pathways.
