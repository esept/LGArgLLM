Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that central banks use interest rates as a tool to influence economic factors (borrowing costs, savings, spending, currency value) which in turn affect inflation rates. Each argument supports this central idea from different angles (demand-pull inflation, economic activity, deflationary pressures, historical data, etc.), but all converge on the same fundamental mechanism.
