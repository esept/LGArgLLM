Result: true  
Justification: All justifications consistently refer to Newtonâ€™s third law as the foundational principle explaining how airplanes generate lift. They describe the interaction between the wings and air (downward deflection of air producing an upward reaction force) as the core mechanism, which aligns with the claim. There is a clear semantic intersection across all arguments.
