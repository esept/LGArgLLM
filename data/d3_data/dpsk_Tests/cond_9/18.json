Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that divisibility by 4 inherently implies divisibility by 2, either through algebraic expression (4k = 2*(2k)), the fact that 4 is a multiple of 2, the prime factorization of 4 (2^2), or general mathematical definitions of divisibility. Thus, they collectively support the claim on the same semantic basis.
