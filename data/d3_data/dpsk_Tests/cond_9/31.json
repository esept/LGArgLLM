Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the same semantic core, which is the calculation of the person's age in 1995 based on their age in 2025 and the time difference between the two years. Each argument uses a slightly different approach (subtracting years, calculating the difference, or adding years to birth year), but all arrive at the same conclusion that the person would be 10 years old in 1995 if they are 40 in 2025.
