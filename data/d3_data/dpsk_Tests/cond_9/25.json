Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core based on the constant 20-year age difference between person A and person B, and the arithmetic calculation (20 + 30 = 50) to determine person A's current age. Each justification reinforces this logic, ensuring a consistent and shared basis for the claim.
