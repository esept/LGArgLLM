Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by explaining why the square of any real number is non-negative, either through algebraic properties (product of a number with itself, multiplying negatives), specific cases (zero), fundamental mathematical principles (real analysis, ordered field properties), or graphical representation (parabola never below x-axis).
