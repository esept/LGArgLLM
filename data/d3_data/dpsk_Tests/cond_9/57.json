Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim "The Earth rotates from west to east." Each justification provides different evidence (Coriolis effect, sunrise/sunset patterns, satellite observations, Foucault pendulum, star trails, angular momentum) that collectively and consistently points to the same rotational direction of the Earth. The intersection of these justifications is the Earth's west-to-east rotation, which is the basis for the claim.
