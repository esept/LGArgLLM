Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core of disjunctive syllogism in propositional logic, where the falsity of one disjunct in a true disjunction necessitates the truth of the other disjunct. Each justification reinforces this logical principle, either by naming the rule (disjunctive syllogism), referring to propositional logic, or invoking truth tables or deductive reasoning.
