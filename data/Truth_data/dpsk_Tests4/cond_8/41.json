Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either references empirical data or studies showing no significant impact on attendance (A1, A3), highlights non-content reasons for attendance like interaction and engagement (A2, A4), or mentions institutional policies maintaining attendance (A5). These themes intersect across multiple arguments, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
