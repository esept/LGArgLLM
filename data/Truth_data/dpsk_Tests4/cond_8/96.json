Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications. The first argument cites the Second Amendment as a constitutional protection, while the second argument refers to specific state laws allowing permitless carry. These are distinct justifications without semantic overlap.
