Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the mathematical definition and properties of averages. For example, the first argument discusses the definition of the average as the central tendency, which is implicitly supported by the other arguments' reasoning about the implausibility of the majority being larger than the average (second argument), the clustering around the average in symmetric distributions (third argument), and the contradiction in shifting the average upward (fourth argument). Thus, all justifications intersect on the core idea that the average represents a balance that cannot be exceeded by the majority of numbers.
