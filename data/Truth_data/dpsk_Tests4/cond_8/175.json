Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that historical records, official documentation, and construction practices confirm that no bodies were left in the Hoover Dam, and all deceased workers were accounted for and properly handled. Each argument reinforces this central idea through different aspects (records, protocols, monitoring, memorials), ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
