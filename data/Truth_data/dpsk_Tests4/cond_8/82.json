Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly references Baumeister's experiments demonstrating ego depletion (A1, A2, A4) or ties the concept to broader psychological understanding (A3). The common theme is the depletion of executive function or self-control, supported by experimental evidence or its influence on subsequent research.
