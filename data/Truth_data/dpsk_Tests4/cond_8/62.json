Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the negative consequences of prematurely assuming success (e.g., overconfidence, poor planning, misallocation of resources, neglect of preparations, unrealistic optimism, and ignoring unpredictability). These themes consistently reinforce the idea that counting unhatched chickens leads to failure, ensuring semantic intersection across all pairs.
