Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the lack of causal connection between dreaming/wishing and real-world success, often citing the passive nature of dreams or the absence of scientific evidence. For example, the idea that dreams are disconnected from reality or lack agency is present in multiple arguments, ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
