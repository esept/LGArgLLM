Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share common themes like technological advancements and economic pressures, not all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about "Official labor statistics show that average weekly working hours in England have increased since 2000" and the argument about "Historical data indicates that the average workweek in England was shorter in the mid-20th century compared to the present day" both rely on statistical data, but their justifications do not overlap semantically with arguments like "Technological advancements have blurred the boundaries between work and personal time," which focuses on a different reasoning pattern. Thus, not all pairs share a common idea or proposition in their justifications.
