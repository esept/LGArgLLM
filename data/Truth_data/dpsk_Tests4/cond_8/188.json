Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that neuroscientific evidence (e.g., fMRI, PET scans, meta-analyses, task-based studies, longitudinal studies, and clinical cases) does not support the idea of left-brain or right-brain dominance. Each argument reinforces this central point by providing different types of empirical data or perspectives, all converging on the lack of evidence for hemispheric dominance in cognitive or personality traits.
