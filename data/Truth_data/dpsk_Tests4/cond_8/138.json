Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim. For example, the arguments about Chicago's population size, diversity, economic significance, tourism, and high rents all intersect in supporting the claim that Chicago is a big, diverse, economically significant city with high rents and lots of tourists. Each pair of arguments overlaps in at least one of these aspects.
