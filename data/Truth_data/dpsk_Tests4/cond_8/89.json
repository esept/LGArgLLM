Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided are a mix of those related to the claim about Paul Dirac and unrelated arguments about working hours in the U.S. The arguments about working hours do not share any semantic overlap with the claim about Paul Dirac winning the Nobel Prize. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
