Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the exceptional nature of consistently achieving over 15% annual returns for a decade, whether by outperforming the S&P 500, demonstrating skill and discipline, adapting to market conditions, showing superior performance through wealth growth, rarity of such performance, or meeting a recognized high-performance threshold. These ideas intersect across all pairs, reinforcing the claim that such an investor is definitely great.
