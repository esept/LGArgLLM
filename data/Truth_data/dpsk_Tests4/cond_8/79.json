Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly compares obesity rates between Mexico and Ireland or discusses factors (e.g., dietary shifts, socioeconomic factors, cultural habits) that contribute to higher obesity rates in Mexico compared to Ireland. The common theme across all justifications is the higher obesity problem in Mexico relative to Ireland, supported by various data points and reasoning patterns.
