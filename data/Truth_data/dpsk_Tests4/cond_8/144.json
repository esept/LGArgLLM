Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Earth's ability to support life is unique due to a combination of rare conditions, lack of evidence for other life-supporting planets, and theoretical frameworks suggesting such conditions are uncommon. Each pair of arguments overlaps in discussing these themes, whether through the Fermi Paradox, Rare Earth Hypothesis, astronomical observations, the Drake Equation, fine-tuning, or the absence of detected biosignatures.
