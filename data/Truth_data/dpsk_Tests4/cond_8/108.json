Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share semantic intersections with the claim "Tiger sharks can't stop swimming." Most of the arguments are about the Roswell incident and unrelated to tiger sharks. Only one argument (the last one) directly addresses the claim about tiger sharks. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
