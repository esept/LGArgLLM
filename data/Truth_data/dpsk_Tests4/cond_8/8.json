Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping justifications (e.g., A1 and A6 both reference population size and consumption data, A2 and A4 both discuss cultural and industry factors), not all pairs have a clear semantic intersection. For example, A3 (diverse alcohol consumption in Europe) and A5 (stricter regulations in Europe) do not share a direct common idea with A2 (American culture driving beer consumption) or A4 (U.S. beer industry strength). Thus, not all pairs have overlapping justifications.
