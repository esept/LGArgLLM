Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that heating water on a stove leads to boiling. The first argument mentions the boiling point (100Â°C) and the second argument explains the mechanism (heat transfer increasing kinetic energy of molecules). Both justifications support the claim by explaining how heating causes boiling, thus overlapping semantically.
