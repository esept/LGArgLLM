Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that the Bermuda Triangle's reputation for mysterious disappearances is unfounded. The first argument states that the disappearance rate is not unusually high, the second dismisses supernatural explanations, and the third notes that many incidents were misreported or debunked. Each pair of arguments overlaps in their shared goal of debunking the myth, even if they focus on different aspects (statistics, lack of evidence, misreporting).
