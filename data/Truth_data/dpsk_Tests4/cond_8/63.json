Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim that cats should only drink water. Each argument emphasizes different aspects of why water is the only suitable liquid for cats, such as hydration, digestive health, toxicity prevention, kidney function, and dietary needs. These justifications collectively support the claim by overlapping in their reasoning that water is essential and other liquids are harmful or unnecessary for cats.
