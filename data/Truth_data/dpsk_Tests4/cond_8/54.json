Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The common themes include AI's design and functionality (executing programmed instructions, operating under predefined constraints), ethical and legal considerations (alignment with human values, legal liability), and the purpose of AI as a tool for human use (compliance with user instructions, behavior governed by human input). These recurring ideas ensure that every pair of arguments has at least one shared proposition or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
