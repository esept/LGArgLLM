Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the Lindbergh kidnapping case was legally resolved, either through Hauptmann's conviction, forensic evidence, the official investigation's conclusion, or the legal changes that followed. Each pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim by reinforcing the idea of a resolved case, even if they emphasize different aspects of the resolution.
