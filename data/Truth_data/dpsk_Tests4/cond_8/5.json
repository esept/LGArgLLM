Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides evidence supporting the idea that London attracts more international arrivals than Paris, whether through tourism rankings, airport traffic, government statistics, international events, business travel, or cultural landmarks. The common theme across all justifications is the comparison of international visitor numbers or factors contributing to higher arrivals in London versus Paris.
