Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common theme of survivorship bias and the role of luck or randomness in explaining sustained high returns, which directly supports the claim. Each pair of arguments overlaps in discussing how factors other than skill (e.g., survivorship bias, randomness, market efficiency, risk, or academic evidence) can explain the observed returns, thus fulfilling the semantic intersection requirement.
