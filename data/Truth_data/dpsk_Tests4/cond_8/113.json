Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim about Nixon and the Watergate scandal. Many of the arguments are unrelated to the claim, discussing topics such as working hours in the U.S., dietary habits in Israel, and investment performance. Only a subset of the arguments directly addresses the claim about Nixon and Watergate, and these do not overlap with the unrelated arguments.
