Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that medical science and evidence do not support the claim that touch alone can cure diseases. They overlap in reasoning about the lack of scientific evidence, the complexity of biological mechanisms, and the necessity of medical interventions. Each pair of arguments intersects on at least one of these points.
