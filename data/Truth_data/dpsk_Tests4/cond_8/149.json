Justification: All arguments share the common idea of comparing economic indicators (GDP per capita, median household income, average wage, productivity, etc.) between the US and Japan, which directly supports the claim about per capita income differences. Each justification overlaps in addressing factors that contribute to higher per capita income in the US relative to Japan.
