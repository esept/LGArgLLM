Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument mentions that Germany, France, and Switzerland are members or closely associated with the European Union where the euro is the official currency, while the second argument focuses specifically on France and Germany being founding members of the Eurozone and having adopted the euro as their sole legal tender. There is no common idea or proposition in their justifications that supports the claim in the same way.
