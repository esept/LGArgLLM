Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly states or implies that English is widely spoken in Ireland, supported by evidence such as official language status, census data, dominance in various sectors (government, education, business), and daily usage. The common theme across all justifications is the prevalence and dominance of English in Ireland, which directly supports the claim.
