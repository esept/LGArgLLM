Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the distinction between short-term weather (e.g., cold outside) and long-term climate trends (global warming). The justifications consistently reinforce the idea that global warming is about long-term trends, not short-term weather fluctuations, and they all reference scientific consensus, historical data, or climate models to support this distinction. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects semantically on these core ideas.
