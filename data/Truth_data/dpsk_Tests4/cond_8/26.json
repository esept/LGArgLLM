Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either cites the lack of scientific evidence for medicinal properties, the composition of pangolin scales (keratin), the absence of recognition by medical organizations, or the lack of empirical support in traditional medicine. These themes are interconnected and reinforce the claim that pangolin scales are not effective medicine.
