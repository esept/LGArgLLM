Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument revolves around the lack of universal scientific acceptance of alternative medicine, whether due to insufficient empirical evidence, lack of endorsement by mainstream institutions, inconsistent study results, contradiction with scientific principles, lack of regulatory approval, or reliance on the placebo effect. These ideas collectively support the claim and intersect in their reasoning.
