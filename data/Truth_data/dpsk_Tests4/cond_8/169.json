Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references historical, scholarly, or cultural evidence (e.g., works by scholars, medieval universities, astronomical concepts, or artistic representations) that collectively support the idea that medieval scholars believed the Earth was round. The common theme across all justifications is the established knowledge and acceptance of a spherical Earth during the Middle Ages.
