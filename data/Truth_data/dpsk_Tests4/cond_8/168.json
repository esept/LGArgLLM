Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that vaccines do not modify DNA, either by explaining the mechanism (e.g., mRNA degradation, lack of interaction with DNA, absence of genome-editing tools) or by citing scientific consensus and evidence (e.g., clinical trials, long-term studies). Each pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim through these shared propositions.
