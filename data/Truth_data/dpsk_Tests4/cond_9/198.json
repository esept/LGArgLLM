Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided focus on different aspects of Princeton University (age, rankings, architecture, and professional schools) but do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim about Ulster men's specific perception or reference to Princeton. The claim combines multiple attributes, but the justifications do not intersect semantically to form a unified basis for the claim as a whole.
