Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not fully overlap in their semantic content. The first justification mentions that all three countries are members or closely associated with the EU where the euro is the official currency, while the second justification specifically states that France and Germany are founding members of the Eurozone and have adopted the euro, but does not mention Switzerland. Therefore, there is no common intersection of all justifications that supports the claim for all three countries.
