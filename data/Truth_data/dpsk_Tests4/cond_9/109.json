Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core centered on the mathematical definition and properties of the average (central tendency), explaining why it is implausible or impossible for the majority of numbers to be larger than the average. Each argument reinforces this idea from slightly different angles (definition, distribution implications, mathematical contradiction), but all align on the same fundamental reasoning.
