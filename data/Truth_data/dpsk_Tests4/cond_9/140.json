Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Each justification supports a different aspect of the claim (e.g., acting career, distinctive looks, marriages and children, online presence, political views), but there is no single overlapping theme that unites all of them. Therefore, there is no shared semantic basis across all justifications.
