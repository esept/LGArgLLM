Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim about Nixon referring to the Watergate scandal. The arguments are disjointed and cover unrelated topics such as working hours in the U.S., dietary habits in Israel, and investment performance, rather than focusing on Nixon's statement and its connection to the Watergate scandal.
