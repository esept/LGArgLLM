Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications provided for the P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They all relate to higher smoking prevalence or consumption in the United States compared to Spain, whether through direct data (prevalence, per capita consumption), policy differences (smoking bans, anti-smoking campaigns, tobacco taxes), or industry factors (tobacco industry size, marketing presence). The overlap in meaning is consistent across all arguments.
