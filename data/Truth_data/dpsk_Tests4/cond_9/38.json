Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim. While they individually support parts of the claim (English being spoken, Christianity being prevalent, and Iceland being pleasant), they do not address the key aspect of the claim regarding annexation by a great continental power. Therefore, there is no common intersection of all justifications that fully supports the claim.
