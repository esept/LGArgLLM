Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that "The moon landings were faked, a fact known by all truthers." Some justifications discuss ego depletion and self-control, which are unrelated to the moon landings, while others provide evidence contradicting the claim by supporting the authenticity of the moon landings. There is no intersection of meaning that supports the claim across all arguments.
