Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided focus on different aspects—data protection laws (UK GDPR) and school/childcare policies—without a common semantic core that directly supports the claim that recording children is illegal in the UK. The arguments address specific contexts (private settings vs. schools/childcare) but do not intersect on a single legal basis for the claim.
