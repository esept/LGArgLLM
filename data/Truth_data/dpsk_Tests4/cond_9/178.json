Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by highlighting the limitations and lack of universal reliability in current machine-based lie detection technologies. Each justification points to different aspects of this core, such as reliance on imperfect physiological responses, lack of perfect accuracy in machine learning models, absence of scientific validation, inability to interpret nuanced cues, and no peer-reviewed evidence for comprehensive lie detection. Collectively, these justifications converge on the idea that no machine can rigorously detect all kinds of lies.
