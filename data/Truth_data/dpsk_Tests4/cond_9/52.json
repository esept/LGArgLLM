Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that nuclear power is safer compared to other energy sources, either through lower fatality rates, advanced safety features, reduced environmental impact, fewer historical deaths, strict regulatory oversight, or minimal radiation risk. Each justification supports the claim by highlighting different aspects of safety, but all converge on the idea that nuclear power is safer than alternatives.
