Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim about tiger sharks. Most of the arguments are about the Roswell incident and unrelated to the claim, except for the last one which mentions tiger sharks' breathing mechanism. There is no intersection in meaning across all justifications to support the claim.
