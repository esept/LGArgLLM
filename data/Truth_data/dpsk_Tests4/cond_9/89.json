Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim about Paul Dirac. Some justifications discuss labor statistics and working hours, which are irrelevant to the claim, while others mention Dirac's Nobel Prize, Jewish heritage, and birthplace. There is no single semantic intersection across all justifications that supports the claim.
