Result: true  
Justification: Both justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim: heating water on a stove causes it to boil. The first justification focuses on the boiling point (100Â°C) being reached due to continuous heating, while the second emphasizes the mechanism (heat transfer increasing kinetic energy). Both converge on the idea that heating leads to boiling, thus supporting the claim.
