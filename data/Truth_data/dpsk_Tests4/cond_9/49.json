Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core focusing on the lack of replicability in Bargh's study, which is essential for establishing a psychological law. Each argument emphasizes different aspects of this core (scientific method requirements, generalizability, methodological flaws), but all converge on the idea that replication failure prevents the study from being a law.
