Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that Americans earn less than people in certain high-income or developed countries, supported by comparisons with specific nations (e.g., Switzerland, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, Qatar, Singapore, Germany, Australia) and metrics (median household income, average wages, purchasing power parity, income inequality). The arguments consistently reinforce this shared basis.
