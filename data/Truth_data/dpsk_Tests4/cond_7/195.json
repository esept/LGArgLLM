Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (historical data, smoking adoption, improved diagnostics, occupational exposures, aging populations) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
