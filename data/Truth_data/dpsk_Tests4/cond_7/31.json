Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., Hauptmann's conviction, forensic evidence, official investigation conclusion, and legal impact), and none of them share a common semantic subset that overlaps in meaning.
