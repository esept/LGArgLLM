Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct aspect of Donald Sutherland's life (e.g., acting career, physical appearance, marriages and children, online presence, political views) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
