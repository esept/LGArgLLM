Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are disjoint with respect to the claim about the moon landings being faked. The first four arguments discuss ego depletion and self-control, which are unrelated to the moon landings. The remaining arguments provide evidence supporting the authenticity of the moon landings, but none of them share a common semantic subset with the first four arguments that would contribute to the support of the claim. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments (e.g., any of the first four with any of the last four) is semantically disjoint.
