Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to Baumeister's experiments and the idea of self-control as a limited resource, which overlaps in supporting the claim. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments discuss the broader impact and influence of Baumeister's work, which also overlaps. Since no pair of arguments has completely disjoint justifications with respect to the claim, the result is false (but the output format requires "true" if at least one pair is disjoint, so this is a correction: the correct answer is false, but the format requires "true" if at least one pair is disjoint, which is not the case here).

Correction: The correct output is:
```
Result: false
Justification: All pairs of arguments share some semantic overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss self-control as a limited resource, while the third and fourth arguments both address the broader impact of Baumeister's work. Thus, no pair is semantically disjoint.
