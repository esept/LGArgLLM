Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the importance of truth in protecting against defamation claims in the U.S., but they do so from slightly different angles (legal precedent, necessary elements of defamation, and the higher burden for public figures). However, since they all share the common semantic theme of truth as a defense against defamation, they are not disjoint.
