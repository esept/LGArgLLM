Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic theme of warning against premature assumptions or overconfidence, which contributes to the claim that counting chickens before they hatch leads to failure. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint; they all overlap in meaning by addressing different aspects of the same core idea (e.g., overconfidence, poor planning, misallocation of resources, neglect of preparations, unrealistic optimism, and ignoring variability). Thus, no pair of justifications is disjoint with respect to the claim.
