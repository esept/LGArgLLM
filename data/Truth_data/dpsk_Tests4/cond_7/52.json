Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim that nuclear power is safer. For example, multiple arguments reference the lower fatality rate or reduced risk compared to other energy sources (e.g., fossil fuels). Additionally, several arguments mention safety features or regulatory oversight, which are semantically related concepts contributing to the overall safety of nuclear power. Thus, no pair of arguments is completely disjoint in their justifications with respect to the claim.
