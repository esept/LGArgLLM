Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic theme of medical science and evidence-based reasoning to argue that touch alone cannot cure diseases. They overlap in their reliance on the lack of scientific evidence, the complexity of biological mechanisms, and the necessity of medical interventions. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
