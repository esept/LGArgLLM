Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content regarding the reasons why very few films are illegal in France. For example, multiple arguments mention the French legal system's approach to film censorship (e.g., classification instead of bans, historical bans being overturned, and legal frameworks for distribution). These overlapping themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
