Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites epidemiological studies linking moderate wine consumption to reduced cardiovascular risk, while the second argument focuses on the presence of antioxidants like resveratrol in red wine. These justifications address different aspects (epidemiological evidence vs. biochemical mechanisms) and do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
