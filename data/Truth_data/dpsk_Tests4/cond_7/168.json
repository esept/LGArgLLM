Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that vaccines do not permanently modify DNA. They all focus on different aspects of how vaccines operate without altering DNA (e.g., immune stimulation, mRNA degradation, lack of interaction with DNA, absence of necessary mechanisms, clinical evidence, and lack of genome-editing tools). Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
