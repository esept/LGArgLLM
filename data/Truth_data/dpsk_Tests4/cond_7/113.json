Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are disjoint with respect to the claim about Nixon and the Watergate scandal. Many of the arguments (e.g., those about working hours, dietary habits in Israel, and investment returns) are entirely unrelated to the claim and do not share any semantic overlap with the arguments that do address the claim. Therefore, there are multiple pairs of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint.
