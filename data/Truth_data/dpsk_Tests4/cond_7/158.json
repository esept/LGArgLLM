Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the per capita or relative representation of Jewish Nobel Prize winners compared to Christians. They all support the claim by emphasizing the disproportionate success of Jewish individuals in winning Nobel Prizes relative to their population size or in specific fields. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
