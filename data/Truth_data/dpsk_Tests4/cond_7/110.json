Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., historical data, gig economy, technological advancements, economic pressures, salaried employees, decline of unions) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. While all support the claim, they do so through separate and independent lines of reasoning.
