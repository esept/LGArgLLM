Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or data point (e.g., median household income, average wages, purchasing power parity, profession-specific salaries, income inequality) to support the claim that Americans earn less than people in certain countries. None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the claim.
