Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the university's architecture (classical and modern) and its high ranking, which are common semantic subsets contributing to the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
