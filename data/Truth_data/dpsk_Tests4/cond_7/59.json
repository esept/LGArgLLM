Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are based on different sources and studies (Pew Research Center, U.S. Census Bureau, ASARB, GSS, historical and cultural data), but they all converge on the same semantic point: Christianity is the most common religion in New York, followed by 60% of the population. Therefore, none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
