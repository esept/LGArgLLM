Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the etymology of the word "shit" from Old English and Proto-Germanic origins. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to supporting the claim by providing overlapping evidence from historical linguistic records, etymological studies, comparative linguistics, and authoritative sources like the Oxford English Dictionary.
