To determine whether the justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, we need to analyze the semantic content of each justification and see if they share any common subset that contributes to the support of the claim.

Let's list the justifications for each argument:

1. Argument A1: "The Commonwealth of Dominica is a sovereign state that does not formally align with any major power bloc, consistent with its non-aligned status." (Justification for non-aligned state)
2. Argument A2: "Dominica was a British colony until gaining independence in 1978, which supports the claim of its former British status." (Justification for formerly British)
3. Argument A3: "Dominica has an international airport, Douglas-Charles Airport, which substantiates the claim about its airport infrastructure." (Justification for having an airport)
4. Argument A4: "The majority of Dominica's population identifies as Roman Catholic, confirming the claim about its large Roman Catholic demographic." (Justification for large Roman Catholic population)

Now, let's analyze the pairs:

- A1 and A2: Justifications are about non-aligned status and former British status, respectively. These are semantically disjoint.
- A1 and A3: Justifications are about non-aligned status and having an airport, respectively. These are semantically disjoint.
- A1 and A4: Justifications are about non-aligned status and Roman Catholic population, respectively. These are semantically disjoint.
- A2 and A3: Justifications are about former British status and having an airport, respectively. These are semantically disjoint.
- A2 and A4: Justifications are about former British status and Roman Catholic population, respectively. These are semantically disjoint.
- A3 and A4: Justifications are about having an airport and Roman Catholic population, respectively. These are semantically disjoint.

All pairs of justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, as they address distinct aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.

Result: true
Justification: All pairs of justifications address distinct aspects of the claim (non-aligned status, formerly British, having an airport, and large Roman Catholic population) without any semantic overlap.
