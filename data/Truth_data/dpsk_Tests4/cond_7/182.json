Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to statistical data and reports (WHO, CDC, Russian health agencies, national health surveys, tobacco industry reports) that support the claim about higher smoking rates in the U.S. compared to Russia. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
