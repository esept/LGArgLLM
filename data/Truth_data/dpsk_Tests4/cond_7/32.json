Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that toads and frogs belong to the same taxonomic order (Anura) and that the distinction between them is based on common naming conventions or morphological differences rather than strict biological taxonomy. This shared semantic content means the justifications are not disjoint.
