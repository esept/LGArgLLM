Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the lack of scientific evidence (e.g., "Scientific studies have found no evidence," "Clinical trials and pharmacological research have not demonstrated any efficacy") and the composition of pangolin scales (e.g., "Pangolin scales are primarily composed of keratin"). These overlaps indicate that the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
