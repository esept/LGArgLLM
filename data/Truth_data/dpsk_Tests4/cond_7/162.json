Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning. For example, one argument discusses the niche popularity of rugby, another focuses on accessibility issues, another on survey data, another on cultural preferences, and another on physical demands. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
