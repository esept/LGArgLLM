Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita, median household income, poverty rate, disposable income, and economic development) that all contribute to supporting the claim that people in Japan are richer than people in Mexico. None of the pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
