Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each address different aspects supporting the claim (e.g., population size, cultural factors, alcohol diversity, industry strength, regulations, and historical data). There is no overlap in the semantic subsets of their justifications that directly contribute to the claim.
