Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they address different mechanisms by which sitting close to the television can cause eyestrain (ciliary muscle contraction, reduced blinking rate, and eye convergence/accommodation). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
