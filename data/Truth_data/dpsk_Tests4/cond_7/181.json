Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on data protection laws (UK GDPR) and parental consent in private settings, while the second argument discusses policies in schools and childcare settings for safeguarding reasons. These justifications address different legal and institutional contexts without overlapping in meaning.
