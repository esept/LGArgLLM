Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments provided are all related to the Roswell incident and terrestrial explanations for it, except for the last argument which is about tiger sharks' breathing mechanism. This last argument is semantically disjoint from the others as it does not share any common semantic subset with the Roswell-related arguments with respect to the claim about tiger sharks. Therefore, there exists at least one pair of arguments (the last one with any of the others) whose justifications are semantically disjoint.
