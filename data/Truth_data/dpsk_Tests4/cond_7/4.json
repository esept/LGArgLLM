Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim. All three arguments provide reasons related to historical context (Tudor period customs, Henry VIII's attire, and artistic conventions of the time) that collectively support the interpretation that King Henry is reaching for a dagger. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to the same line of reasoning.
