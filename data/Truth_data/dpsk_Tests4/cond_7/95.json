Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way. For example, one argument discusses the freedom of movement within a barn, another mentions the variability of outdoor access based on farming practices, another talks about regulation by animal welfare standards, and the last one focuses on natural behaviors. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
