Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim about Paul Dirac. The first six arguments discuss working hours and labor trends in the U.S., which are unrelated to the claim about Paul Dirac. The remaining arguments directly address the claim about Paul Dirac's Nobel Prize, Jewish heritage, and British birth. Since there is no overlap in meaning between the first six arguments and the claim, the justifications are semantically disjoint.
