Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim (ALS awareness, long history, state-of-the-art training facilities, and recognition as Boston's primary team) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
