Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides distinct and non-overlapping information: one about James Watson's birth and Nobel Prize, another about Gerald Edelman's birth and Nobel Prize, another about official Nobel Prize records, another about birth records, and the last about scientific literature. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim.
