Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the historical origin and lack of original meaning for SOS. They all support the claim by providing different pieces of evidence (historical records, international conventions, backronyms, and communication manuals) that collectively reinforce the idea that SOS did not originally stand for anything. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
