Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument cites a different field (psychological studies, neuroscience, art history, cognitive science, empirical studies on creativity) and provides distinct reasons (combining existing ideas, exposure to stimuli, influence of earlier movements, memory and experience, cross-domain knowledge) to support the claim. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
