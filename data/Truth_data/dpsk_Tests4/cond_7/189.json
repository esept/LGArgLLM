Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., survivorship bias, random chance, efficient market hypothesis, high risk, academic studies) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
