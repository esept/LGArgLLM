Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the outperformance of the S&P 500 (e.g., "significantly outperforms the average annual return of the S&P 500" and "outperforming the market consistently for a decade"), the rarity and skill required to achieve such returns (e.g., "statistically rare, suggesting exceptional investment acumen" and "requires skill, discipline, and effective risk management"), and the recognition of 15% as a high-performance threshold (e.g., "widely recognized in finance as a high-performance threshold"). These overlapping themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
