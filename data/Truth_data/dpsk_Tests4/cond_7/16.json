Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference comparative smoking rates (prevalence, per capita consumption) and policy differences (smoking bans, anti-smoking campaigns, tobacco taxes) between the United States and Spain. These overlapping themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
