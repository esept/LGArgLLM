Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share the common semantic theme that kissing a frog does not lead to any transformation or significant effect, either due to biological reasons, lack of magical properties, absence of scientific evidence, or the fictional nature of the trope. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are completely disjoint with respect to the claim.
