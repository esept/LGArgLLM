Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Spanish not being spoken by all Hispanics, the second on Portuguese being spoken by Brazilians who are culturally Hispanic, and the third on English being spoken by some Hispanics in the U.S. Each justification addresses a distinct linguistic scenario without overlapping in meaning.
