Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on traits like diplomacy and sociability (linked to charm), while the second argument discusses intelligence and analytical skills (linked to being smart). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
