Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments about Christianity in New York are semantically disjoint from the justifications for the arguments about birds' inability to speak English. There is no overlap in meaning between the two sets of arguments with respect to the claim. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments (e.g., any argument about Christianity paired with any argument about birds) is semantically disjoint.
