Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., cultural tradition, beef production, dietary variety, health trends, historical consumption, economic factors), and none of the justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in meaning.
