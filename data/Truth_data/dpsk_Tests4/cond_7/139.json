Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that knuckle cracking does not cause any negative health effects. The justifications overlap in meaning as they all refer to scientific studies or medical research findings that show no evidence of harm from knuckle cracking.
