Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or context for why the books might be banned in Ireland (e.g., historical censorship, specific legal frameworks, protection of younger audiences, historical reception of 'Ulysses', etc.), and none of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
