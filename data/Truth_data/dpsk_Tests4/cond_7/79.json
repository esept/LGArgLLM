Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both reference obesity rates in Mexico and Ireland, albeit from different sources (WHO vs. national health surveys). Similarly, the third and fifth arguments both discuss dietary factors contributing to obesity, though they focus on different aspects (processed foods vs. sugary beverages). However, the fourth argument introduces a distinct point about socioeconomic factors, which is not covered by the other arguments. Therefore, there is at least one pair of arguments (e.g., the first and fourth) whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
