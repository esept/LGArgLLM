Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the arguments about Barrie's proximity to large bodies of water and Montreal's urban heat island effect both indirectly relate to the environmental factors affecting snowfall, but they address different aspects (moisture availability vs. temperature effects). However, the argument about historical weather data and climatological studies both directly reference empirical data, indicating some overlap in their support for the claim. Despite this, there are pairs of arguments (e.g., the first and last arguments) whose justifications are semantically disjoint, as they address different mechanisms (continental weather patterns vs. Great Lakes proximity) without overlapping in their support for the claim.
