Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification refers to the Second Amendment's protection of the right to bear arms, while the second justification discusses specific state laws allowing permitless carry. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
