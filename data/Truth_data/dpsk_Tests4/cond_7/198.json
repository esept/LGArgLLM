Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, the first justification ("Princeton University is a private Ivy League institution founded in 1746, making it one of the oldest universities in the United States.") and the second justification ("Princeton University is widely recognized for its undergraduate education and frequently ranks highly in national and global university rankings.") both contribute to the claim's assertion that Princeton is the oldest and most famous university that often tops rankings. Similarly, the third and fourth justifications also support different aspects of the claim (architecture and professional schools). Since there is semantic overlap in how these justifications support the claim, no pair is disjoint.
