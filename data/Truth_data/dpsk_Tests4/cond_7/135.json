Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are all disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct piece of evidence (e.g., Trump's presidency period, Time's Person of the Year for 2021 and 2023, and no former president selected after Trump) that does not overlap semantically with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
