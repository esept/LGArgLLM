Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the statistical comparison of ship disappearances, the second on the lack of supernatural evidence, and the third on the debunking of reported incidents. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
