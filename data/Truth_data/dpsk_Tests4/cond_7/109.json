Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the mathematical definition and implications of the average, while the third and fourth arguments focus on distribution properties and the shifting of the average. There is overlap in their semantic content regarding the relationship between the majority of numbers and the average.
