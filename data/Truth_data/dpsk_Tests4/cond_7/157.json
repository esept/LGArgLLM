Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share overlapping semantic content related to how dreams about success influence motivation through neural, emotional, or cognitive mechanisms. For example, arguments about the brain's reward system, self-efficacy beliefs, and emotional arousal all contribute to the claim in related ways, meaning they are not semantically disjoint.
