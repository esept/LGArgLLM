Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the historical military victories, the second on the public celebrations and patriotic displays, and the third on the cultural recognition and unifying aspects. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim.
