Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., labor statistics, technological advancements, gig economy, economic pressures, remote work, historical data) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
