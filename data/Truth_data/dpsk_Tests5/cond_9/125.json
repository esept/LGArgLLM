Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that challenges the notion of breastfeeding significantly impacting a child's intelligence. The first justification points to empirical studies showing no significant IQ difference when controlling for other factors, while the second emphasizes the dominance of genetic and environmental influences over breastfeeding. Together, they converge on the idea that breastfeeding does not have a substantial effect on intelligence, supporting the claim's assertion about the lack of strong scientific evidence.
