Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. While all arguments support the claim that US incomes are less unequal than in Canada, they do so based on different metrics and reasons (Gini coefficient, share of high-income earners, income distribution among the top 1% vs. the rest, and regional disparities). There is no single overlapping semantic basis across all justifications.
