Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that wet hair in cold weather leads to increased heat loss or cooling effects, which in turn causes a sensation of chilliness. Each argument supports this core idea through different mechanisms (thermal conductivity, evaporation, reduced heat retention, thermoregulatory response), but all converge on the same underlying reason for the claim.
