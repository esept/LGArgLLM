Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that pangolin scales lack scientific or empirical evidence for medicinal efficacy. The justifications consistently highlight the absence of clinical trials, pharmacological research, regulatory approvals, and peer-reviewed support, as well as the biologically inert nature of keratin in pangolin scales. This unified basis supports the claim that pangolin scales are not effective medicine.
