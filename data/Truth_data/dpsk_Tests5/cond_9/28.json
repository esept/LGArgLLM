Result: false  
Justification: While all justifications support the claim that euros are used in Germany and France, none of them mention Switzerland's currency. Switzerland is not part of the EU or the Eurozone and uses the Swiss franc, not the euro. Therefore, there is no common semantic intersection across all justifications that fully supports the claim for all three countries.
