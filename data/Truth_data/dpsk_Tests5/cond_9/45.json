Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by highlighting Africa's high poverty levels, extreme poverty rates, and poor development indicators compared to other continents. Each justification reinforces the idea that Africa, as a continent, has the highest poverty burden globally, whether through statistical measures (e.g., World Bank data, HDI scores), geographical distribution (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa), or comparative analysis (e.g., least developed countries). The overlap in meaning is clear and consistent.
