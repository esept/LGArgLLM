Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that vaccines do not interact with or alter human DNA. They collectively support the claim by explaining different aspects of how vaccines work (e.g., immune stimulation, mRNA degradation, lack of necessary enzymes, scientific consensus, and absence of interaction with the cell nucleus). Each justification reinforces the idea that vaccines do not permanently modify DNA, aligning with the claim.
