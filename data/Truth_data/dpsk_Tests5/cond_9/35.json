Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that England lacks a formal legal framework for banning books, prioritizes freedom of expression, and has repealed historical bans, leading to very few books being banned by law. The justifications collectively support the claim by emphasizing the legal and cultural factors that make book bans rare in England.
