Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on Dirac's Nobel Prize win for his contributions to quantum mechanics, the second on his British nationality, and the third on the criteria for the Nobel Prize unrelated to his religious or ethnic background. There is no single overlapping semantic basis that all justifications support.
