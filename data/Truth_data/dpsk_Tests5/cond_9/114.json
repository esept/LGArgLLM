Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the mechanisms by which sitting close to the television can cause eyestrain, such as eye muscle fatigue, reduced blinking, blue light exposure, disrupted focal adjustment, and screen brightness. Each justification supports the claim by highlighting a different aspect of how proximity to the television affects eye comfort and function.
