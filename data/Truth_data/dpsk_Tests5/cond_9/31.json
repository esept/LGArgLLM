Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification either directly states or implies that Bruno Hauptmann was the perpetrator of the Lindbergh kidnapping, providing legal resolution, forensic evidence, and historical consensus. The absence of credible alternatives further reinforces this shared basis. Thus, the combined justifications collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
