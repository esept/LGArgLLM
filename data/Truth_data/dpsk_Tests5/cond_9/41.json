Justification: All P-type arguments share the common semantic core that providing video recordings of lectures does not significantly affect class attendance because students value in-person interaction, immediate feedback, and the structured learning environment of physical classrooms. The justifications consistently emphasize that recordings are used as supplementary resources rather than replacements, and empirical data supports the stability of attendance rates.
