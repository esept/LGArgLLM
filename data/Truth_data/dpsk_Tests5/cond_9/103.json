Result: true  
Justification: All justifications support distinct aspects of the claim (independence from the UK, non-aligned status, presence of an airport, and large Roman Catholic population) without contradicting each other. Each justification aligns with a different part of the claim, collectively covering all its components. Therefore, there is a shared semantic core supporting the claim.
