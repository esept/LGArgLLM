Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that "Gestapo's Last Orgy was banned by British censors due to its explicit or morally harmful content," which directly supports the claim. Each argument provides a different facet of this core (e.g., classification as a 'video nasty,' BBFC refusal, DPP list inclusion, violation of standards, moral harm), but all converge on the same conclusion.
