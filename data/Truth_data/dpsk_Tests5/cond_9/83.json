Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that the moon landings were faked. Instead, they provide evidence that contradicts the claim by supporting the authenticity of the moon landings (e.g., photographic/video evidence and lunar samples analyzed by scientists). There is no intersection in meaning that aligns with the claim.
