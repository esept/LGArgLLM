Result: true  
Justification: All justifications consistently support the claim that the object that crashed during the Roswell incident was a balloon. They reference official military statements, known military balloon programs (like Project Mogul), the materials recovered, and subsequent government investigations, all aligning with the conclusion that the debris was from a balloon and not extraterrestrial in origin. The semantic core across all justifications is the identification of the object as a balloon based on consistent evidence and official accounts.
