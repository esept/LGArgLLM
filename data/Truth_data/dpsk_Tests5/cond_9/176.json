Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that Type 1 diabetes is not caused by specific foods, particularly sugar, and instead emphasize its autoimmune nature, genetic/environmental factors, and distinction from Type 2 diabetes. The justifications consistently support the claim by refuting the misconception and providing alternative explanations for the cause of Type 1 diabetes.
