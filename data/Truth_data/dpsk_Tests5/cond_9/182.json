Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by providing evidence of higher smoking prevalence in the United States compared to Russia, whether through statistical data (WHO, CDC, per capita consumption) or contextual factors (public health policies, cultural attitudes). The justifications consistently align in meaning to support the claim.
