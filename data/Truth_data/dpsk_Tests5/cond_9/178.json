Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications collectively emphasize the limitations of current lie detection technologies, their inability to account for all variables (e.g., stress, cultural differences, complex human behavior), and the lack of scientific validation for universal accuracy. This intersection of meaning consistently reinforces the claim that no machine can rigorously detect all kinds of lies.
