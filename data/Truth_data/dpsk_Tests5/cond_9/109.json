Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that the definition of the average and the concept of majority are inherently linked in a way that makes it impossible for the majority of numbers to be larger than the average. Each argument reinforces this by explaining how the average would shift or how the remaining numbers would need to balance the average, leading to a contradiction if the majority were larger than the average.
