Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core centered around UK laws and regulations (Data Protection Act 2018, safeguarding policies, GDPR, Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, Human Rights Act 1998) that restrict or prohibit the recording of children without consent or proper authorization. This collective legal framework forms the basis for the claim that recording children is illegal in the UK.
