Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that brain imaging technology (e.g., fMRI, PET scans, meta-analyses) shows no evidence of hemispheric dominance, and cognitive functions involve integrated activity across both hemispheres. This refutes the left-brain/right-brain distinction. The justifications consistently support this unified conclusion.
