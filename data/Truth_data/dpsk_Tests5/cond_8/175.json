Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that no bodies were buried in the Hoover Dam due to historical records, official reports, construction protocols, concrete pouring techniques, memorial plaques, and modern forensic investigations. Each pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim by providing different pieces of evidence or reasoning that collectively confirm the absence of buried bodies in the dam.
