Justification: All the arguments share the common semantic justification that there is no definitive evidence or consensus on who designed the first American flag. Each argument highlights different aspects of this lack of consensus, such as the absence of historical records, multiple credited individuals, lack of documentation by the Continental Congress, ongoing debates among scholars, and the absence of primary source evidence. These justifications all intersect in their core message that no single designer can be conclusively identified.
