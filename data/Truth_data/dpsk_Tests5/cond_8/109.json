Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common semantic justification that the definition of the average and the concept of majority are inherently linked in a way that makes it impossible for the majority of numbers to be larger than the average. Each argument reinforces this idea by explaining how the average would shift or why the majority cannot be larger than it, creating a consistent overlap in reasoning.
