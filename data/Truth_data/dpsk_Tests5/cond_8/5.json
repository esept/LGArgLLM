Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping justifications (e.g., London's global connectivity due to its airport system and financial hub status), others do not directly intersect (e.g., visa policies vs. language dominance). Not all pairs of arguments share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
