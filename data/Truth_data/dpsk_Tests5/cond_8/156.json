Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on self-reported feelings of power and risk tolerance, the second on the concept of embodied cognition, and the third on hormonal changes alongside self-reported feelings. These are distinct aspects of the power pose experiments and do not overlap semantically.
