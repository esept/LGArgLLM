Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either references the lack of scientific evidence, the composition of pangolin scales (keratin), the absence of regulatory or organizational support, or the lack of documented cases in peer-reviewed literature. These themes consistently intersect across all pairs, reinforcing the claim that pangolin scales are not effective medicine.
