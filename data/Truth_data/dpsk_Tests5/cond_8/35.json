Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses aspects of England's legal framework or principles (e.g., freedom of expression, lack of formal book bans, reliance on general laws) that collectively support the claim that very few books are banned in England. The justifications consistently reference legal principles, historical context, and modern practices that align with the claim's assertion about the rarity of book bans in England.
