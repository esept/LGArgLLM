Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the rarity or uniqueness of Earth's conditions for supporting life, whether through direct observation (e.g., "only known planet with confirmed life"), the rarity of habitable conditions, the Fermi Paradox, or the complexity of Earth's biosphere. These justifications collectively reinforce the idea that Earth is uniquely capable of supporting life in the universe.
