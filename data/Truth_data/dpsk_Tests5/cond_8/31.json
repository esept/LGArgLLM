Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. The justifications revolve around the legal resolution of the case (Hauptmann's conviction), forensic evidence linking Hauptmann to the crime, the lack of substantial evidence for alternative theories, the official closure of the case, and the historical consensus supporting Hauptmann's guilt. These justifications collectively reinforce the idea that the case was solved, even if alternative theories exist, and they overlap in their support for the claim.
