Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim that aircraft trails are water-based. Each argument discusses aspects of water vapor, ice crystals, or atmospheric conditions that lead to the formation of contrails, which are scientifically recognized as water-based. The common themes include the role of aircraft exhaust, atmospheric moisture, and the physical properties of contrails, ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
