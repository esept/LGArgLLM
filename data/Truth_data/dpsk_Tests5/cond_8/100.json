Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share overlapping themes (e.g., increased working hours, economic pressures, changes in work arrangements), not all pairs necessarily share a direct semantic intersection in their justifications. For example, the argument about "Official labor statistics" and the argument about "The gig economy" may not directly overlap in their justifications, as one relies on statistical data and the other on changes in work arrangements. Thus, not all pairs share a common idea or reasoning pattern.
