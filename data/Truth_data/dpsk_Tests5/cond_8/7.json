Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that a monkey's paw has the supernatural ability to grant wishes, as depicted in literature and folklore. The first argument specifically references the short story 'The Monkey's Paw' by W.W. Jacobs, while the second argument broadens the context to include folklore and literature in general. Both justifications support the claim by emphasizing the wish-granting function of the monkey's paw.
