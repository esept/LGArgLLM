Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the exceptional nature of consistently achieving over 15% annual returns for a decade, whether by outperforming benchmarks like the S&P 500, demonstrating skill in risk management and market timing, or showcasing deep market knowledge and disciplined execution. The common theme across all justifications is the rarity and skill required to achieve such sustained high returns, which collectively support the claim that such an investor is definitely great.
