Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the negative consequences of assuming uncertain future outcomes (unhatched chickens) as certain, leading to failure through overconfidence, poor planning, misallocation of resources, or distraction from necessary preparations. The common theme is the risk of failure due to premature reliance on uncertain events.
