Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share a common semantic intersection in their justifications. While some arguments overlap in discussing per capita consumption or market volume (A1 and A2), others focus on cultural traditions (A3) or the rise of craft beer (A4), which are distinct justifications not directly overlapping with the others.
