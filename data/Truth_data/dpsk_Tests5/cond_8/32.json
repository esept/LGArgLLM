Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes that toads are biologically classified as frogs, either by referencing taxonomy (e.g., "subset of frogs," "family Bufonidae," "broader category of frogs"), morphological/genetic traits, or the common name distinction. The core idea—that toads are a type of frog—is consistently supported across all justifications.
