Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses a specific aspect of food affordability (e.g., rising food prices, stagnant income growth, declining purchasing power, food insecurity, or real wages) and how it contributes to decreased affordability. For example, arguments about rising food prices (CPI, USDA data) overlap with arguments about income stagnation (median household income, real wages) in their focus on the imbalance between costs and income. Similarly, arguments about food insecurity and purchasing power both address the broader impact of reduced affordability. Thus, all pairs share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
