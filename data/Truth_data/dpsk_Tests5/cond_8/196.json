Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the passive nature of mirrors and the lack of scientific evidence or physical mechanisms by which a mirror placed by the bed could cause any particular effect. The common themes include the absence of physical or chemical changes, lack of empirical support for superstitions, and the inert nature of mirrors. These shared ideas ensure that every pair of arguments has at least one overlapping justification supporting the claim.
