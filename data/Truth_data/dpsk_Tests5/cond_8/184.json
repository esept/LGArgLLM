Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that excavation is a primary or fundamental activity for archaeologists, which directly supports the claim that archaeologists spend most of their time excavating historical sites.

Both justifications overlap in their focus on the centrality of excavation in archaeological work.
