Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to income inequality metrics (e.g., Gini coefficient, middle class size, poverty rates, progressive taxation, wage disparity) that supports the claim that US incomes are less unequal than those in Brazil. The justifications consistently compare these factors between the US and Brazil, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
