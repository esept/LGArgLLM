Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument either cites statistical data (e.g., WHO, CDC, global health statistics) comparing smoking rates or per capita consumption between the U.S. and Russia, or discusses policy or cultural factors (e.g., tobacco control policies, cultural attitudes) that influence smoking rates. These themes are interconnected and support the claim consistently.
