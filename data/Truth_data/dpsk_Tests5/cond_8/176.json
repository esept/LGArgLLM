Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes that Type 1 diabetes is not caused by dietary factors (e.g., sugar intake) and instead highlights its autoimmune nature, genetic/environmental causes, or distinction from Type 2 diabetes. These common themes ensure semantic intersection across all pairs.
