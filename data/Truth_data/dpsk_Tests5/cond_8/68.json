Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes that medical science, biological processes, or evidence-based treatments do not support the idea that touch alone can cure diseases. The common themes include the need for specific medical interventions, the complexity of disease mechanisms, and the lack of scientific evidence for touch-based cures.
