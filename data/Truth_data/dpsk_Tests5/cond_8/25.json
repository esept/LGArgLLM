Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to the claim. For example, the arguments about population size and diversity both support the idea of NYC being "biggest and most diverse." The arguments about economic hub status and tourism both relate to NYC being an "economic hub with lots of tourists." The argument about expensive rents directly supports the claim's mention of "very expensive rents." Thus, all justifications intersect semantically in supporting the claim.
