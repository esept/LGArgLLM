Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Gestapo's Last Orgy was banned by British censors due to its content violating UK standards. The justifications overlap in mentioning the film's explicit or graphic nature, its classification as morally harmful, and its inclusion on banned lists under UK censorship laws.
