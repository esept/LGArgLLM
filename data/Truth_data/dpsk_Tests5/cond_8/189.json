Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to survivorship bias and the difficulty of consistently achieving high returns. For example, the first and fourth arguments both explicitly mention survivorship bias, while the second and third arguments both discuss the rarity or unlikelihood of persistent outperformance, which is related to the idea of survivorship bias. Thus, all pairs have at least one common idea in their justifications that supports the claim.
