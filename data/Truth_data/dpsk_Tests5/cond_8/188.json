Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that modern brain imaging and neuroscientific research refute the notion of left-brain or right-brain dominance. Each justification emphasizes the lack of empirical evidence for hemispheric dominance, the involvement of both hemispheres in cognitive functions, or the debunking of the left-brained/right-brained dichotomy. The semantic overlap is clear, as all justifications support the claim by referencing neuroscientific studies, meta-analyses, or clinical findings that contradict the dominance theory.
