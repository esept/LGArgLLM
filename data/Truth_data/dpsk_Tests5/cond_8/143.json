Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that lawyers in the U.S. are legally and ethically prohibited from giving false evidence to exonerate their clients. The justifications overlap in referencing professional conduct rules, legal consequences (perjury laws, sanctions, disbarment), and the ethical duty of candor toward the tribunal. Each pair of arguments intersects on at least one of these core concepts supporting the claim.
