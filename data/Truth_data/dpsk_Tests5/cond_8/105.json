Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on different economic indicators (GDP per capita, median household income, poverty rate, social welfare, and cost of living vs. wages) that collectively support the idea that people in Japan are richer than people in Mexico. These indicators are all related to wealth and income, ensuring semantic overlap between any pair of arguments.
