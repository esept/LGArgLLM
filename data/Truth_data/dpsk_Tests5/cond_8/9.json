Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic intersection in relation to the claim, as they all address different facets of why determining the greatest basketball player of all time is ambiguous. Each argument highlights a distinct reason (e.g., era differences, statistical variability, team dependencies, subjective accolades, cultural preferences, contested definitions), but all converge on the idea that no single, unambiguous determination can be made. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim's ambiguity.
