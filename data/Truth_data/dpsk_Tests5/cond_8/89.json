Result: false
Justification: The justifications do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first justification focuses on Dirac's Nobel Prize and his contributions to quantum mechanics, the second on his birthplace and nationality, and the third on the criteria for the Nobel Prize unrelated to religious or ethnic background. There is no overlap in semantic content between all pairs of justifications.
