Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that nuclear power is safe based on various authoritative studies and comparisons with other energy sources. Each argument either cites a reputable organization (IAEA, WHO, IPCC) or provides statistical evidence (fatality rates, health impacts, safety features) to support the claim that nuclear power is safe. The overlapping idea is the safety and low risk of nuclear power as concluded by major studies and organizations.
