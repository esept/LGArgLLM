Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides statistical or demographic evidence supporting the prevalence of Christianity in New York, either through surveys (Pew Research Center, U.S. Census Bureau), historical immigration patterns, or consistent ranking in religious affiliation studies. The common idea across all justifications is the dominance of Christianity in New York's religious landscape.
