Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes that dreams or wishes made during dreams lack the necessary causal power, intentionality, or evidence to influence real-world success. Common themes include the subjectivity of dreams, the importance of real-world actions, the lack of scientific evidence, and the randomness of dream content. These shared ideas ensure that every pair of arguments intersects semantically in supporting the claim.
