Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument (implicitly) suggests that the moon landings were faked and known by truthers, while the second argument (explicitly) provides evidence supporting the authenticity of the moon landings (NASA's evidence and lunar samples). There is no common idea or reasoning pattern between these arguments that supports the claim; in fact, they contradict each other.
