Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to Baumeister's ego depletion experiments and their implications for executive function. The first argument discusses the experimental results showing depletion, the second connects this to broader psychological concepts, and the third mentions the influence on subsequent research. Each pair overlaps in discussing aspects of ego depletion and its impact on executive function.
