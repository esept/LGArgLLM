Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common theme of how sitting close to the television can lead to eyestrain, albeit through different mechanisms (e.g., eye muscle fatigue, reduced blinking, blue light exposure, focal disruption, brightness adaptation). Each pair of arguments overlaps in addressing the claim's core concern about eyestrain caused by proximity to the screen.
