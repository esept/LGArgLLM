```
Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. For example, the arguments about Chicago's population size, diversity, economic significance, tourism, and rental costs all intersect in supporting the claim that Chicago is a big, diverse, economic hub with high rents and many tourists. Each pair of arguments overlaps in at least one of these aspects.
