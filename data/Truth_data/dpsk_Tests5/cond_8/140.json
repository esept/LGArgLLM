Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct aspect of Donald Sutherland's life (e.g., career, physical features, personal life, online presence, political views) without shared reasoning or propositions. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
