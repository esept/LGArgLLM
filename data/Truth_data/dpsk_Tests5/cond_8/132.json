Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. For example:
- A1 and A5 both reference statistical data on coffee consumption (per capita consumption vs. average cups per day).
- A2 and A4 both mention cultural or environmental factors (traditions in Mexico vs. climate/agricultural conditions).
- A3 overlaps with A1 and A5 by discussing relative consumption preferences (alternative beverages vs. direct consumption comparisons).
Thus, every pair of arguments has at least one overlapping justification idea supporting the claim.
