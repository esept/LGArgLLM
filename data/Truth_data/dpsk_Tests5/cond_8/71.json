Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides evidence that fortune cookies were developed in California (e.g., mass-produced by Japanese immigrants, developed by American companies, commercialized by local bakeries) and that they lack a traditional or documented history in China (e.g., not a traditional Chinese food, no resemblance in Chinese cuisine, no prior appearance in China). These common ideas reinforce the claim that fortune cookies originated in California, not China.
