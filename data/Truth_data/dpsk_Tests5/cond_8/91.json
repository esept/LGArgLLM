Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument supports a different aspect of the claim (e.g., population size, diversity, tourist attractions, wealth, and foreign visitors), but they all collectively reinforce the idea that New York City is the "biggest and most diverse city, our cultural and media capital, with the most tourist attractions, foreigners, and rich people." The justifications are complementary and do not contradict each other, ensuring semantic overlap in supporting the claim.
