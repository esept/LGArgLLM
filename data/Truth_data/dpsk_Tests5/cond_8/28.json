Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided all support the claim by stating that Germany and France use the euro, but none of them mention Switzerland's currency. Therefore, there is no overlap in the justifications regarding Switzerland, which is part of the claim. Hence, not all pairs of arguments share a common idea related to the entire claim.
