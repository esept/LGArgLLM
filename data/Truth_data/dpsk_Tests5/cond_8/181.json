Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references specific UK laws (e.g., Data Protection Act 2018, GDPR, Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, Human Rights Act 1998) or policies (e.g., safeguarding policies, child protection laws) that regulate or prohibit the recording of children without consent. The common theme across all justifications is the legal and ethical restrictions on recording children in the UK, ensuring semantic overlap for every pair.
