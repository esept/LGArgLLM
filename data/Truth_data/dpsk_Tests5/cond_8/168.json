Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes that vaccines do not interact with or alter human DNA, either by explaining the mechanism (e.g., mRNA degradation, lack of necessary enzymes, no entry into the nucleus) or by citing authoritative consensus (e.g., CDC, WHO, peer-reviewed studies). These justifications consistently reinforce the same core idea that vaccines do not permanently modify DNA.
