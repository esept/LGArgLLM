Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses limitations or flaws in current lie detection technologies, emphasizing their inability to universally and accurately detect all forms of lying due to factors like physiological variability, lack of perfect accuracy, complexity of human behavior, reliance on indirect indicators, and cultural differences. These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments intersects in their reasoning about the claim.
