Result: false
Justification: While many pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications (e.g., economic pressures and corporate policies both relate to workplace demands), not all pairs do. For example, the argument about historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not semantically overlap with the argument about technological advancements blurring work-life boundaries. These two arguments address distinct aspects of the claim without shared reasoning or propositions.
