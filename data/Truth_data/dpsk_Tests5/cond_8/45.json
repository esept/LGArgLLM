Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that Africa, as a continent, has the highest levels of poverty globally. Each argument provides different supporting evidence (e.g., World Bank data, UN classifications, poverty rates, HDI scores), but they all converge on the same core idea that Africa's poverty burden is the highest among all continents. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their semantic justification in relation to the claim.
