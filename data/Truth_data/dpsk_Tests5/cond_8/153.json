Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument either references the Old English origin ('scitte'), the Proto-Germanic roots, or the broader context of linguistic studies confirming the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the Old English and Proto-Germanic origins, while the third and fourth arguments reinforce these points with comparative and historical linguistic evidence. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects in supporting the claim through shared linguistic or etymological reasoning.
