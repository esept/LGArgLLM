Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that heat energy from the stove causes the water to reach its boiling point, which is necessary for the water to boil. The first argument states the condition (reaching boiling point temperature), and the second argument explains the mechanism (heat transfer from the stove). Both justifications are directly related to the claim and support it by explaining the process of boiling water.
