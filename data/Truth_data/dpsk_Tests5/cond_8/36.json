Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications as they all discuss the concept of entrapment in the U.S. legal system and how it can prevent prosecution. Each argument touches on different aspects of entrapment, such as the requirement for law enforcement not to create intent, the distinction between providing an opportunity and encouraging a crime, and the subjective and objective tests for entrapment. These ideas are interconnected and collectively support the claim.
