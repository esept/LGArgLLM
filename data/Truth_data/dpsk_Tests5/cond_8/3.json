Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument's justification refers to the functional purpose of vomitoriums as passageways in Roman stadiums, supported by historical evidence, architectural records, and modern archaeological studies. The common idea across all justifications is that vomitoriums were designed for crowd management in large public venues, not for vomiting.
