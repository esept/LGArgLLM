Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that Donald Trump was not selected as Time's Person of the Year in the years following his presidency, with each argument providing specific examples (2016 election, 2022 selection of Zelensky, 2023 selection of Swift) to support this claim. The justifications overlap in their focus on Trump's non-selection relative to other individuals chosen by Time.
