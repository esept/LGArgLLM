Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct pieces of evidence supporting the claim. The first argument focuses on Trump's election year and Time's selections since then, the second on the 2022 selection being a non-U.S. president, and the third on the 2023 selection being a non-political figure. None of the justifications overlap in their supporting evidence for the claim.
