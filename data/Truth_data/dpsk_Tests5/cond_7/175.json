Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that no bodies are buried in the Hoover Dam. They all reference historical records, official reports, construction protocols, or modern investigations that confirm the removal of bodies and the absence of human remains in the dam. Therefore, none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
