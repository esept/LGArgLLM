Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., ALS awareness, long history, iconic stadium, championships, training facilities, global popularity), and none of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
