Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each address different aspects of the claim. The first justification focuses on the narrative twist, the second on the cultural impact, and the third on the thematic element. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
