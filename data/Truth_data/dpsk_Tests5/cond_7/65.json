To determine whether the justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, we need to analyze the semantic content of each justification and see if there is any overlap in meaning that contributes to supporting the claim.

Here are the justifications for the arguments:
1. "Psychological studies show that creativity often involves the recombination of existing ideas from diverse sources."
2. "Neuroscientific research indicates that exposure to varied stimuli enhances creative cognition in artists."
3. "Art history demonstrates that artistic movements frequently emerge from cross-cultural influences and shared inspirations."
4. "Empirical studies in cognitive science confirm that memory and perception play key roles in artistic idea formation."
5. "Educational research supports the idea that interdisciplinary learning fosters creative development in artists."

Analysis:
- Justification 1 discusses the recombination of ideas from diverse sources.
- Justification 2 talks about exposure to varied stimuli enhancing creativity.
- Justification 3 mentions cross-cultural influences and shared inspirations.
- Justification 4 highlights memory and perception in idea formation.
- Justification 5 focuses on interdisciplinary learning fostering creativity.

While all justifications support the claim that artists take inspiration from various sources, they do so from different angles (psychology, neuroscience, art history, cognitive science, and education). There is no direct semantic overlap in the justifications themselves; each provides a distinct reason or evidence supporting the claim. 

Thus, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

```
Result: true
Justification: The justifications provide distinct reasons or evidence (from psychology, neuroscience, art history, cognitive science, and education) supporting the claim without semantic overlap.
