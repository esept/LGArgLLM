Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., Spanish not being universal, indigenous languages, Portuguese in Brazil, English dominance in the U.S., local languages in non-Spanish-speaking countries) supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
