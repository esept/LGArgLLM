Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments relate to the same central themeâ€”that the Lindbergh kidnapping case was officially solved with Bruno Hauptmann's conviction, and alternative theories lack substantial evidence. They overlap in supporting the claim by reinforcing Hauptmann's guilt and the legal resolution of the case. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
