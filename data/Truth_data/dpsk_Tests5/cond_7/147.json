Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint, as they all relate to the broader theme of decreasing food affordability in America. However, they each focus on different aspects (e.g., CPI vs. income growth vs. food insecurity), so there is no exact semantic overlap in their justifications. Thus, at least one pair is disjoint.
