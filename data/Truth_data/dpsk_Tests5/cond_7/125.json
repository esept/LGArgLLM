Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on empirical evidence from large-scale studies showing no significant IQ difference, while the second argument discusses the broader context of cognitive development being influenced by multiple factors beyond breastfeeding. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
