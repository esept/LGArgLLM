Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each justification provides a distinct reason (not overlapping in meaning) for why it is legal to kill a praying mantis in the U.S.: (1) the praying mantis is not listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, (2) state wildlife protection laws do not include the praying mantis, and (3) general animal cruelty laws do not protect insects. These reasons do not share a common semantic subset.
