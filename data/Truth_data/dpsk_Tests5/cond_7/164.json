Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic theme: they all argue that wardrobes in real life are ordinary and lack any magical or extraordinary properties. They overlap in meaning by collectively emphasizing the mundane nature of wardrobes and the absence of any scientific or historical basis for extraordinary effects. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
