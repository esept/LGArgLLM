Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim. All three arguments highlight the high representation or achievement of Jewish individuals in Nobel Prizes, either through disproportionate numbers, per capita rates, or cultural emphasis on education. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
