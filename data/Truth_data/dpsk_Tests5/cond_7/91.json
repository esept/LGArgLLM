Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to different aspects of the claim (e.g., population size, diversity, tourist attractions, wealth, and foreign visitors), but they all contribute to supporting the overall claim about New York City. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim; they all overlap in their support for the claim's various descriptors.
