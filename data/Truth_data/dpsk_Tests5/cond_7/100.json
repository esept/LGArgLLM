Let's analyze the semantic content of the justifications for each pair of arguments to determine if at least one pair is disjoint.

Argument pairs and their justifications:
1. A1 (Official labor statistics...) vs. A2 (Economic pressures...)
   - A1: statistical evidence of increased working hours.
   - A2: economic reasons for increased working hours.
   - These are disjoint as one provides data while the other provides causes.

2. A1 vs. A3 (Historical data...)
   - A1: statistical evidence of increased working hours.
   - A3: historical trend showing decreased leisure time (implying increased work).
   - These overlap in showing increased work time through different metrics.

3. A1 vs. A4 (The gig economy...)
   - A1: statistical evidence of increased working hours.
   - A4: structural changes in employment leading to longer hours.
   - These are disjoint as one shows data while the other explains mechanisms.

4. A1 vs. A5 (Surveys report...)
   - A1: statistical evidence of increased working hours.
   - A5: survey data about overtime work.
   - These overlap in providing different types of statistical evidence.

5. A2 vs. A3
   - A2: economic reasons for increased work.
   - A3: historical trend showing decreased leisure time.
   - These are disjoint as one explains causes while the other shows effects.

6. A2 vs. A4
   - A2: economic reasons for increased work.
   - A4: structural employment changes leading to longer hours.
   - These overlap in explaining different causes for increased work time.

7. A2 vs. A5
   - A2: economic reasons for increased work.
   - A5: survey data about overtime work.
   - These are disjoint as one explains causes while the other provides evidence.

8. A3 vs. A4
   - A3: historical trend showing decreased leisure time.
   - A4: structural employment changes leading to longer hours.
   - These are disjoint as one shows effects while the other explains causes.

9. A3 vs. A5
   - A3: historical trend showing decreased leisure time.
   - A5: survey data about overtime work.
   - These overlap in providing different evidence of increased work time.

10. A4 vs. A5
    - A4: structural employment changes leading to longer hours.
    - A5: survey data about overtime work.
    - These are disjoint as one explains mechanisms while the other provides evidence.

We can see multiple pairs (e.g., A1-A2, A1-A4, A2-A3, A2-A5, A3-A4, A4-A5) where the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

Result: true
Justification: Multiple argument pairs (e.g., A1-A2, A1-A4, A2-A3) have justifications that are semantically disjoint, addressing different aspects (data vs. causes vs. mechanisms) of the claim without overlapping meaning.
