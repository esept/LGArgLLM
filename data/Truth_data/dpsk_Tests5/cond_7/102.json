Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the official status of English in Ireland (constitution, education system, media, business) and the high percentage of English speakers (census data, native language of majority). These justifications share common semantic subsets that contribute to the claim, so no pair is completely disjoint.
