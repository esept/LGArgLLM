Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the specific fictional origin and description of the monkey's paw in a particular story, while the second justification discusses a broader pattern in folklore and literature regarding cursed objects. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that directly supports the claim.
