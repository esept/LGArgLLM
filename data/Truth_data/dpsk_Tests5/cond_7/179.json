Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the safety of nuclear power, but they do so by citing different aspects (e.g., fatality rates, health impacts, safety features, radiation exposure, low-carbon benefits, and comparative death rates). While they all support the claim, their justifications are semantically distinct and do not share a common semantic subset. Therefore, there is at least one pair of arguments whose justifications are disjoint with respect to the claim.
