Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common theme of historical censorship and controversial content, which directly supports the claim about the books being banned in Ireland. The first argument discusses the general controversial themes of the books, the second mentions Ireland's history of censorship, and the third specifically notes the past legal challenges of 'Ulysses'. These justifications overlap in their support of the claim by referencing historical and contextual reasons for the ban.
