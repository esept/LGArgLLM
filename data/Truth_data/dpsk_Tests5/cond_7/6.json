Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share overlapping semantic content related to the practicality and historical accuracy of ninja clothing, such as blending into natural environments and the availability of certain fabrics. For example, multiple arguments mention the impracticality of black clothing in natural settings and the preference for dark blue or earth tones. Therefore, the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
