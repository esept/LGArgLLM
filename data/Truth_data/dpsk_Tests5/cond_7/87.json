Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., cultural tradition, beef production, dietary habits, statistical data, dietary trends, and geographic conditions). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
