Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the freedom of movement within a barn or enclosed area, while the second justification mentions outdoor access as part of animal welfare standards. These are distinct points supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
