Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the concept of ego depletion and its relation to executive function, while the third argument also ties into Baumeister's work and its broader impact on research. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are entirely disjoint in meaning with respect to the claim.
