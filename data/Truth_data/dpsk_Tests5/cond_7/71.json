Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both reference the historical origin of fortune cookies in California and their absence in China, overlapping in their semantic contribution to the claim. Similarly, the third and fifth arguments both discuss the development and commercialization of fortune cookies in California. Since there are overlapping semantic subsets among the justifications, the condition for all pairs being disjoint is not met.
