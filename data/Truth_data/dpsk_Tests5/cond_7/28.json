Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share the common semantic subset that Germany and France use the euro as their official currency, which directly supports the claim. The first argument also mentions Switzerland, but the overlap in meaning between the arguments regarding Germany and France means they are not disjoint.
