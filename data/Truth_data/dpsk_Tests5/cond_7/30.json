Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically as they all discuss the necessity of exchanging dollars into the local currencies (euros for France and krone for Denmark) when traveling to these countries. For example, multiple arguments mention that France uses the euro and Denmark uses the krone as their official currencies, and that currency exchange is required for transactions. This shared semantic content means the justifications are not disjoint.
