Given the arguments provided, we need to determine if at least one pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. 

Let's analyze the justifications:
1. Vaccines stimulate the immune system without altering genetic code.
2. mRNA degrades quickly and does not integrate into DNA.
3. DNA modification requires specific enzymes not present in vaccines.
4. Scientific consensus states vaccines do not interact with DNA.
5. Vaccines' genetic instructions don't enter the cell nucleus.
6. No credible study shows permanent DNA modification from vaccines.

All these justifications are supporting the claim by providing different but complementary reasons why vaccines don't modify DNA. They cover different aspects (mechanisms, scientific consensus, lack of evidence) but all contribute to the same conclusion. There is no pair where the justifications are completely unrelated or disjoint in their support for the claim.

Result: false
Justification: All justifications provide overlapping or complementary support for the claim, with no semantically disjoint pairs.
