Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why cats should only drink water, such as their biological adaptation to water, lactose intolerance, kidney function, toxicity of other beverages, and the natural safety of water. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
