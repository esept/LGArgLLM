Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., repeal of historical bans, rarity of challenges, legal protections, education policies, public records, lack of a comprehensive list). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
