Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., Gini coefficient, share of high-income earners, concentration of wealth among the top 1%, regional income disparities) to support the claim, and none of these reasons overlap in meaning.
