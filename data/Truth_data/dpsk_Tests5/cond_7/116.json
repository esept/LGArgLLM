Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., lack of empirical evidence, violation of biological laws, no credible observations, mythological origin, absence in modern studies) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
