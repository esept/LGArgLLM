Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to poverty in Africa, whether it's through statistics (number of people in extreme poverty, poverty rate), classifications (least developed countries, HDI scores), or comparisons (sub-Saharan Africa's share of global poverty). None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
