Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to how the progressive tax system in the U.S. ensures that only the portion of income in the higher bracket is taxed at the higher rate, leading to an overall increase in take-home earnings. None of the pairs of arguments have disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
