Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the effects of close proximity to the television on the eyes (e.g., eye muscle fatigue, reduced blinking frequency, blue light emission, disrupted focal adjustment, and high brightness). These justifications share a common theme of how sitting close to the television can lead to eyestrain, making them not semantically disjoint.
