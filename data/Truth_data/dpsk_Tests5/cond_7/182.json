Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and fifth arguments both reference data from authoritative health organizations (WHO and CDC/Russian health ministries) to support the claim about higher smoking prevalence in the U.S. compared to Russia. Similarly, the second and fourth arguments both touch on cultural or consumption factors contributing to higher smoking rates in the U.S. However, since there are multiple pairs of arguments with overlapping justifications, the condition that at least one pair is disjoint is not met. Therefore, the result is false based on the given definition.
