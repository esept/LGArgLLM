Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic themeâ€”they all argue that medical science and biological processes do not support the idea that touch alone can cure diseases. They overlap in meaning by referencing the lack of evidence, the complexity of physiological mechanisms, and the necessity of specific medical treatments. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
