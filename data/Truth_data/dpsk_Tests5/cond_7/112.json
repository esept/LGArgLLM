Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the outperformance of the S&P 500 (A1, A4, A6), the demonstration of skill or traits of a great investor (A2, A5), and the rarity or statistical significance of such returns (A3, A6). These overlaps indicate that the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
