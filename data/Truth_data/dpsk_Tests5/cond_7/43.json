Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference Canada's legal protections for freedom of expression (e.g., the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, high legal thresholds, and court rulings favoring free speech). Additionally, several arguments mention the absence of centralized censorship or the rarity of bans in practice. Thus, the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
