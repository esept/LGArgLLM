Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all overlap in their support of the claim by highlighting different limitations of current lie detection technologies. For example, arguments about physiological responses being influenced by unrelated factors and the lack of perfect accuracy across all contexts both contribute to the same overarching point that machines cannot rigorously detect all kinds of lies. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
