Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to income comparisons with specific high-income countries (Switzerland, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark), which overlaps in meaning. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both discuss factors affecting real income (PPP adjustments and income inequality). Therefore, there are pairs of arguments whose justifications share a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim.
