Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., lack of scientific evidence, absence of regulatory approvals, composition of keratin, lack of recognition by health organizations, etc.) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning.
