Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., niche sport status, lack of top popularity rankings, physical demands, and cultural significance without majority appeal). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
