Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the ability of certain parrot species to mimic and comprehend human language, while the second argument emphasizes scientific studies showing birds' ability to associate words with meanings and respond contextually. Although both support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping justifications.
