Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common theme of lack of definitive evidence or consensus on the designer of the first American flag, with overlapping references to historical records, multiple credited individuals, lack of documentation, ongoing debates, and absence of primary sources. Therefore, the condition that at least one pair is disjoint is not met.
