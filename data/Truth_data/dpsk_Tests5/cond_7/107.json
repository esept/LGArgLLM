Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the claim that the object that crashed during the Roswell incident was a balloon. They all reference evidence or statements supporting the idea that the debris was from a balloon (e.g., military statements, materials consistent with balloons, Project Mogul, eyewitness accounts, government investigations). Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
