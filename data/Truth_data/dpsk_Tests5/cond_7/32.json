Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim that toads are a type of frog. For example, the first and fourth arguments both reference biological or taxonomic classification, while the second and third arguments discuss morphological and naming distinctions. Since there is semantic overlap between at least one pair of arguments (e.g., the first and fourth arguments both discuss taxonomy), the justifications are not all disjoint.
