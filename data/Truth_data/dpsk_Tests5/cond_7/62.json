Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around the idea that prematurely assuming success (counting unhatched chickens) leads to failure due to overconfidence, poor planning, misallocation of resources, or distraction. While they share a common theme, they each present distinct reasons (e.g., overconfidence vs. misallocation of resources vs. distraction) that do not semantically overlap in a way that contributes to the claim. Thus, at least one pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
