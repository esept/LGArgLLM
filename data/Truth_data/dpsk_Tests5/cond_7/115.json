Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., natural detoxification systems, lack of scientific evidence, nutrient deficiency, lack of mainstream support) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
