Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the legal framework in France (e.g., strict but clear laws, classification system, international agreements) and the role of institutions (e.g., Conseil d'Ã‰tat) in reducing the number of illegal films. These justifications share common semantic elements related to legal and societal factors that contribute to the rarity of illegal films in France.
