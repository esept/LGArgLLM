Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically related but not identical. For example, "Japan has a higher GDP per capita than Mexico" and "The median household income in Japan is significantly higher than in Mexico" are distinct but related points about economic indicators. Similarly, "Japan has a lower poverty rate compared to Mexico" and "Japan's social welfare system and public services are more developed" are separate but overlapping justifications. However, the argument about "The cost of living in Japan is higher than in Mexico, but average wages still result in greater purchasing power for Japanese citizens" introduces a new dimension (purchasing power) that is not covered by the other justifications. Thus, there is at least one pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
