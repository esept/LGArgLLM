Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim. For example, the first and fourth arguments both discuss how a balanced diet supports bodily functions and health, while the second and fifth arguments both mention chronic diseases as a consequence of poor diet. The third argument aligns with the others by referencing scientific consensus on dietary variety. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
