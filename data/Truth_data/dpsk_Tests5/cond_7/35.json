Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided share a common semantic theme related to the legal framework (or lack thereof) in England that makes book bans rare. They overlap in discussing aspects like the absence of a legal framework for banning books, prioritization of freedom of expression, repeal of historical bans, lack of a formal list, protection under the Human Rights Act, and the nature of book restrictions. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
