Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the justification for the first argument (about London's airport system) does not overlap with the justification for the second argument (about visa policies and Commonwealth ties). Similarly, the other justifications (global financial hub, focus on European vs. non-European tourism, English language dominance) each address distinct reasons supporting the claim without semantic overlap.
