Result: false
Justification: All justifications provided are related to the context of the Watergate scandal and Nixon's statement "I am not a crook." They overlap in their focus on the timing, historical records, and the direct link between the statement and the scandal. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
