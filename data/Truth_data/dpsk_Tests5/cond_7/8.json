Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument cites per capita consumption statistics, while the second focuses on the total market volume. The third argument discusses cultural preferences for other alcoholic beverages, and the fourth highlights the impact of craft beer popularity. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
