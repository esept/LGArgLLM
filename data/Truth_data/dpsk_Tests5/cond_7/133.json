Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the claim by discussing different aspects of Hong Kong's climate that contribute to high humidity. They overlap in meaning as they all support the claim by providing reasons for the consistent humidity in Hong Kong (subtropical climate, monsoon season, coastal location, high humidity levels). Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
