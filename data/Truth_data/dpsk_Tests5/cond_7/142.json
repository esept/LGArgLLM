Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification states that Hayek won the Nobel Prize in 1974, while the second justification discusses his contributions to economic theory. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim about Hayek being an American (which is incorrect, as Hayek was Austrian-British) or winning the Nobel Prize.
