Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why making a wish in a dream does not guarantee success, such as the subjective nature of dreams, the role of actions in success, lack of scientific evidence, randomness of dream content, and lack of intentionality. These reasons do not overlap in meaning but collectively support the claim.
