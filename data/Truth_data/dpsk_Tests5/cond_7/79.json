Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, arguments about Mexico's higher obesity rates (e.g., WHO data, national health surveys) and Ireland's stricter public health policies share a common semantic subset related to comparative obesity rates between the two countries. However, some arguments (e.g., dietary habits in Mexico, demographic studies) introduce distinct points that do not directly overlap with others, making at least one pair disjoint.
