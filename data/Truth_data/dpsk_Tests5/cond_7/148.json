Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic theme that distinguishes between short-term weather (like a cold day) and long-term climate trends (global warming). They overlap in meaning by emphasizing that local or temporary cold weather does not contradict global warming, which is about long-term patterns. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
