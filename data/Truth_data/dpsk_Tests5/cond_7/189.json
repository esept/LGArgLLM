Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and fourth arguments both directly address survivorship bias and its impact on evaluating investor performance, sharing a common semantic subset related to the exclusion of failed investors. Similarly, the second and third arguments both discuss the rarity or unlikelihood of consistent outperformance, which is another overlapping semantic theme. Thus, there are pairs of arguments whose justifications are not disjoint.
