Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on photographic and video evidence provided by NASA, while the second argument discusses the analysis of lunar samples by scientists. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
