Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the critical acclaim and recognition of "Schindler's List" (e.g., Academy Awards, AFI criteria, film studies citations). Additionally, several arguments highlight the film's historical significance and cultural impact, which are also part of AFI's ranking criteria. Thus, the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
