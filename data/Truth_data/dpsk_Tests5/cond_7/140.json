Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument focuses on a distinct aspect of Donald Sutherland's life and career (e.g., acting career, distinctive looks, marriages and children, online presence, political views), and there is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
