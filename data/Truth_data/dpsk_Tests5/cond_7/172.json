Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the collaborative nature of the flag's design involving Francis Hopkinson, the second on the 19th-century myth-making trend, and the third on the lack of official records mentioning Betsy Ross. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
