Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on self-reported feelings of power and risk tolerance, the second on the theoretical framework of embodied cognition, and the third on hormonal changes alongside self-reported feelings. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
