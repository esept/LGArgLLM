Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. They all discuss the minority status of Muslims in EU countries, either by citing statistical data, research reports, or demographic studies. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
