Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on Dirac's Nobel Prize award for his contributions to quantum mechanics, the second on his birthplace confirming his British nationality, and the third on the criteria for the Nobel Prize unrelated to religious or ethnic background. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
