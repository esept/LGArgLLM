Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., lower accident-related fatalities, advanced safety features, minimal air pollution, stable energy supply), and none of the justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in meaning.
