Let's analyze the justifications of the arguments to determine if any pair is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

Arguments:
1. A1: "Gum is indigestible and passes through the digestive system intact, causing no harm."
   - Justification: Gum cannot be digested and exits the body without causing harm.

2. A2: "Swallowing gum occasionally does not lead to any known medical complications."
   - Justification: Occasional swallowing of gum has no known negative medical effects.

3. A3: "The human digestive system cannot break down the synthetic components of gum, so it is excreted unchanged."
   - Justification: Gum's synthetic parts are not digestible and are excreted as-is.

4. A4: "There is no scientific evidence that swallowing gum causes intestinal blockages or other health issues."
   - Justification: No scientific proof links gum swallowing to blockages or health problems.

5. A5: "Medical consensus holds that swallowing gum is harmless unless done in extremely large quantities."
   - Justification: Medical experts agree gum is safe unless swallowed in very large amounts.

6. A6: "Gum does not stick to the intestines or stomach, contrary to popular myths."
   - Justification: Gum does not adhere to digestive organs, debunking a common myth.

Analysis:
- All justifications revolve around the idea that gum is not digested, passes through the body without causing harm, and does not lead to medical issues unless consumed in extreme amounts.
- There is significant overlap in the semantic content of the justifications. For example, A1, A3, and A6 all discuss how gum interacts with the digestive system without causing harm.
- None of the justifications introduce a completely unrelated or disjoint idea. They all support the claim by addressing different aspects of the same core idea: gum is harmless when swallowed.

Since no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is False.

```
Result: false
Justification: All justifications share overlapping semantic content supporting the claim that swallowed gum is harmless, focusing on indigestibility, lack of medical complications, and debunking myths. No pair is completely disjoint.
