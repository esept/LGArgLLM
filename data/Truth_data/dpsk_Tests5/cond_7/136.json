Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications relate to the process of water boiling due to heat transfer, with the first focusing on the boiling point temperature and the second on the heat energy transfer from the stove. These concepts overlap in explaining why the water boils when watched on the stove.
