Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all revolve around the lack of scientific evidence and validation for cryptids, often overlapping in their reasoning (e.g., lack of peer-reviewed studies, absence of empirical evidence, burden of proof not met). Thus, there is no pair of arguments whose justifications are completely disjoint with respect to the claim.
