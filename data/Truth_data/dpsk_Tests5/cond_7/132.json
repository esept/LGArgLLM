Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument cites per capita consumption data, while the second focuses on cultural traditions. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way. Each argument provides a distinct reason for the observed difference in coffee consumption between the US and Mexico.
