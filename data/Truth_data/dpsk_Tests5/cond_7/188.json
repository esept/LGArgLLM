Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic theme: they all provide evidence from neuroscientific studies, cognitive tasks, meta-analyses, educational research, clinical studies, and modern neuroimaging techniques to refute the idea of left-brain or right-brain dominance. The justifications overlap in meaning as they collectively support the claim by showing that brain functions are distributed and integrated across both hemispheres, rather than being localized to one hemisphere. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
