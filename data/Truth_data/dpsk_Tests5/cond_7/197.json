Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments overlap in their support of the claim. Both justifications refer to the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and its awarding to individuals, which directly supports the claim that James Watson and Gerald Edelman won the Nobel Prize for Physiology. Therefore, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
