Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by asserting that Donald Trump's name is indeed his legal name, with no evidence or allegations suggesting otherwise. The first argument directly states there is no credible evidence of another name, and the second reinforces this by implying that any discrepancy would have been exposed due to his high-profile status. Both justifications converge on the same point, supporting the claim's validity.
