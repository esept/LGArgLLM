Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Each argument presents a distinct reason (cyclical trends, economic factors, mining production, global economic stability) that could lead to gold's value declining, but these reasons are not overlapping or based on the same underlying premise. Therefore, there is no single semantic intersection across all justifications.
