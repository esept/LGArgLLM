Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument cites the Gini coefficient, the second mentions regional income disparities, and the third discusses labor market dynamics and wage growth. These are distinct aspects of income inequality and do not intersect semantically to form a unified basis for the claim.
