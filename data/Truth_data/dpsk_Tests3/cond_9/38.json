Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided focus on different aspects of the claim (standard of living, English proficiency, religious demographics, and population size), but none address the key part of the claim about Iceland being "annexed and taken over by a great continental power." Therefore, there is no common semantic core that supports the entire claim.
