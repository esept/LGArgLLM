Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification argues that replication failures are common and do not necessarily invalidate findings, while the second justification states that the study contributed to broader understanding despite overestimation. These points do not intersect to support the claim that the study did not establish a psychological law due to replication failure.
