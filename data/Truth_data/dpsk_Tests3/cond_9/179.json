Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that nuclear power is safe when compared to other energy sources, either by highlighting lower mortality rates, robust safety systems, minimal radiation risks, or the outlier nature of historical accidents. Each argument reinforces the claim's assertion of nuclear power's safety relative to other energy sources.
