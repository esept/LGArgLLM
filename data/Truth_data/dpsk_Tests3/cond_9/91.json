Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on the historical connection and immigration patterns of Ulstermen to New York City, while the second justification emphasizes the global recognition of New York City as a cultural and media capital. These are distinct points that do not intersect semantically to form a unified support for the claim.
