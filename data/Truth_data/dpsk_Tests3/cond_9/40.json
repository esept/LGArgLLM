Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument links short hair to practicality and efficiency as traits of intelligence, while the second argument associates short hair with prioritizing intellectual pursuits over appearance. These are distinct reasons and do not intersect semantically.
