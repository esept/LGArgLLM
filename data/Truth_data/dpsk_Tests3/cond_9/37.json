Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first justification suggests that some banks have security features that detect suspicious behavior, while the second mentions rare, experimental, or localized systems. These are not overlapping or identical in meaning, and thus do not collectively support the claim on the same semantic basis.
