Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that non-commercial use (not making money off the copyrighted work) is a key factor in protecting against copyright infringement claims in the U.K. The first argument mentions fair dealing exceptions for non-commercial uses, and the second argument highlights specific exceptions requiring non-commercial use. Both justifications align with the claim's focus on non-commercial use as a protective measure.
