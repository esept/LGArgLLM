```
Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments' justifications share a common semantic core that coughing can help maintain circulation during a cardiac arrest, which aligns with the claim's assertion that coughing mimics CPR's effects. The first argument mentions increasing intrathoracic pressure to maintain blood flow, and the second references documented cases of cough CPR maintaining circulation, both supporting the claim's central idea.
