Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that the film was banned by British censors due to its content and the regulatory environment at the time. The first justification mentions the inclusion in the 'video nasties' list by the British Board of Film Classification, while the second refers to the film's subject matter and exploitation style fitting the criteria for censorship under British media regulations. Both support the claim by providing reasons related to British censorship practices.
