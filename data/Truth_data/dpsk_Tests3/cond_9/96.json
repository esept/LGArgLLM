Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first justification refers to the Second Amendment's protection of gun ownership rights, while the second focuses on specific state laws allowing gun carry without permits. These are distinct legal bases and do not intersect semantically to support the claim uniformly.
