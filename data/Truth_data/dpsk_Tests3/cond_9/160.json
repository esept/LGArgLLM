Result: false  
Justification: The two arguments provide different justifications for the claim. The first argument focuses on the decline in household expenditure on food as a percentage of income, while the second argument cites government subsidies and policies. These justifications do not share a common semantic core, as they address different factors (income proportion vs. government intervention) to support the claim.
