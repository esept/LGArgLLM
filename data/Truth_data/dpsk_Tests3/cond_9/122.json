Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that Bem's study had methodological flaws and failed to replicate, which undermines its validity and the establishment of any scientific phenomenon. The justifications consistently point to issues like questionable research practices, failed replications, methodological flaws, and violations of experimental design principles, all converging on the conclusion that the study did not firmly establish a scientific phenomenon.
