Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided focus on different aspects of lie detector tests (physiological responses, examiner accuracy, and institutional usage) but do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim's accuracy in all contexts. Each justification addresses a different facet of the argument without overlapping in meaning to form a unified basis for the claim.
