Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic basis supporting the claim that Barrie gets more snowfall than Montreal. The first argument justifies this by explaining Barrie's geographical advantage (proximity to large bodies of water), while the second argument provides empirical evidence (historical weather data). Both justifications directly support the claim by highlighting factors that lead to higher snowfall in Barrie compared to Montreal.
