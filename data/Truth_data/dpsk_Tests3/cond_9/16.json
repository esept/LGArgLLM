Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on smoking-related illnesses, the second on cultural attitudes, and the third on the tobacco industry and marketing. While all relate to smoking rates, they address different aspects (health outcomes, cultural factors, and industry influence) without a single shared semantic basis.
