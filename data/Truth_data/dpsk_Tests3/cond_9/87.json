Result: true  
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by highlighting Argentina's high per capita beef consumption in comparison to the U.S. The justifications emphasize Argentina's global ranking, historical and policy support for beef consumption, and cultural significance of beef, all of which contrast with the U.S. context. This consistent focus on Argentina's higher beef consumption relative to the U.S. forms a shared semantic basis for the claim.
