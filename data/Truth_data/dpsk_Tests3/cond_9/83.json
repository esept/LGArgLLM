Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Each argument presents a distinct reason (lack of stars in photos, Van Allen radiation belts, waving flag) without overlapping meaning or a unified basis for the claim. Thus, there is no shared semantic intersection across all justifications.
