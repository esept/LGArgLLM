Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that Baumeister's experiments and related studies provide evidence for the depletion of executive function, either through direct experimental results, theoretical frameworks, or meta-analyses. Each justification supports the claim by reinforcing the idea that executive function can deplete, albeit from slightly different angles (experimental results, theoretical support, and statistical evidence).
