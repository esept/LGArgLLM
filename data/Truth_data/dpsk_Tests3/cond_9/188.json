Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that modern brain imaging technology (e.g., fMRI, meta-analyses) does not support the left-brain/right-brain dominance theory, either due to distributed cognitive functions, lack of consistent neural patterns, or misinterpretation of earlier studies. This collective evidence refutes the distinction between left-brained and right-brained thinkers.
