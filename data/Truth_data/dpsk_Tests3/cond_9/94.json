Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim. While each argument highlights different aspects of Columbia University's reputation (global ranking, urban campus and law school, architecture), none of them specifically address the claim that the Welsh describe Columbia as one of their most famous universities. The arguments are about Columbia's general prestige and features, not its recognition or ranking by the Welsh.
