Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first argument cites epidemiological studies showing a correlation with reduced cardiovascular disease risk, while the second argument refers to clinical trials showing short-term improvements in biomarkers like HDL cholesterol. These are distinct types of evidence and do not intersect semantically.
