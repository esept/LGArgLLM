```
Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument suggests that past growth indicates future growth due to adoption and acceptance, while the second argument focuses on scarcity driving demand and price increases. Both arguments counter the claim but do so on different semantic grounds (adoption vs. scarcity), so there is no shared semantic intersection.
