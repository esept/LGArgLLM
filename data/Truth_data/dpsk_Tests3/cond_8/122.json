Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on different aspects of why Bem's study did not replicate or establish a scientific phenomenon, such as questionable research practices, failed replications, methodological flaws, violations of experimental design principles, and pre-registered replications showing no evidence. These justifications all converge on the idea that the study's findings are unreliable and non-replicable, thus supporting the claim.
