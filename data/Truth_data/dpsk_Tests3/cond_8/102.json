Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The arguments all revolve around the dominance and widespread use of English in Ireland, whether through historical context (colonization), practical usage (education, government, media), statistical evidence (census data), or economic factors (tourism and business). Each pair of arguments intersects on the idea that English is pervasive and widely spoken in Ireland.
