Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss the legalization of previously banned films due to changing societal norms and liberal attitudes. The third argument complements the first two by explaining the current system's approach to film restrictions, which aligns with the idea of fewer outright bans. Thus, all pairs have at least one common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
