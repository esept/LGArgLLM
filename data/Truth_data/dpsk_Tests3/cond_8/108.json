Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss the necessity of continuous movement for tiger sharks (for breathing and hunting, respectively). The first and third arguments both address the biological mechanisms (or lack thereof) related to breathing while stationary. The second and third arguments both implicitly support the idea that tiger sharks cannot stop swimming due to their biological and behavioral adaptations.
