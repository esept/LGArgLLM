Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss the climate and environmental factors (subtropical climate and proximity to the South China Sea) contributing to high humidity. The first and third arguments both mention factors (subtropical climate and frequent rainfall) that lead to high humidity. The second and third arguments both relate to environmental influences (maritime influence and rainfall) that maintain high humidity levels in Hong Kong.
