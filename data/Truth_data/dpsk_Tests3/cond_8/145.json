Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the film was banned by British censors due to its content and the regulatory environment at the time. The first argument mentions its inclusion in the 'video nasties' list, while the second argument highlights its subject matter and exploitation style as reasons for censorship. Both justifications support the claim by pointing to the film's controversial nature and the British censorship response.
