Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The first argument mentions the high mortality rate of skin cancer among women, the second argument cites the American Cancer Society's report on skin cancer being the most commonly diagnosed and melanoma accounting for most deaths, and the third argument discusses increased UV exposure leading to higher mortality. All justifications intersect on the idea that skin cancer (particularly melanoma) is a leading cause of death among women in the U.S., supported by either mortality rates, statistical reports, or contributing factors like UV exposure.
