Result: false
Justification: While the arguments share a common theme of supporting the claim that Earth is uniquely capable of supporting life, their justifications do not all overlap semantically. For example, the first argument focuses on the Earth's position in the habitable zone, while the second argument emphasizes the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without a common underlying proposition or reasoning pattern. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications.
