Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument emphasizes the provision of essential nutrients, the second highlights the consequences of nutrient deficiencies, and the third focuses on immune function. All three arguments revolve around the necessity of a balanced diet for maintaining health, either by providing nutrients, preventing deficiencies, or supporting immune function. Thus, they intersect in their support of the claim that a balanced diet is necessary for health.
