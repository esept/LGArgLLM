Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that coughing can mimic or serve as a temporary substitute for CPR by maintaining blood flow or circulation during a cardiac event. The first argument focuses on the mechanism (increased intrathoracic pressure), while the second cites medical literature supporting its use in specific cases. Both justifications support the claim by linking coughing to CPR-like effects in heart attack scenarios.
