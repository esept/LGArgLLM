Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses survivorship bias obscuring the true distribution of investor success, the second mentions external factors like market conditions or luck, and the third highlights the lack of a broad comparison sample. While they emphasize different aspects, all three arguments converge on the idea that consistent high returns alone are insufficient to attribute skill due to confounding factors (survivorship bias, luck, or lack of comparison). Thus, every pair intersects on the core reasoning that non-skill factors could explain the observed returns.
