Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first and second arguments both focus on the evidence against Bruno Hauptmann (his conviction and the traced ransom money/handwriting), which supports the claim that the case was solved. The third argument also overlaps with the first two by acknowledging the strength of the evidence against Hauptmann compared to alternative theories, reinforcing the claim's assertion of a resolution despite alternative theories.
