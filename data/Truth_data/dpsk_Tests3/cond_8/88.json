Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument cites historical data showing a decrease in working hours from the late 19th century to the 21st century, while the second argument attributes the decline to the rise of part-time and gig economy jobs. These justifications rely on different reasoning patterns and evidence.
