Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. The first argument discusses the experimental demonstration of depletion in self-control tasks, the second argument mentions the theoretical framework supported by multiple experiments, and the third argument refers to meta-analyses showing a small but significant effect size. All three justifications revolve around the idea that Baumeister's experiments and related studies support the depletion of executive function, thus overlapping in their support for the claim.
