Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share overlapping themes (e.g., logical explanations for disappearances, statistical insignificance, media sensationalism), not all pairs have a direct semantic intersection in their justifications. For example, the argument about "misreporting of geographical boundaries" does not directly overlap with the argument about "cultural fascination with the unexplained." Thus, not all pairs share a common idea or reasoning pattern.
