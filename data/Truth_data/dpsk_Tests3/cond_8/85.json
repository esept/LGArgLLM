Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that non-commercial use (not making money off the copyrighted work) can protect against copyright infringement in the U.K. The first argument mentions "fair dealing" exceptions for non-commercial uses, while the second argument specifies that some exceptions explicitly require non-commercial use. Both justifications support the claim by highlighting the role of non-commercial intent in reducing infringement risks.
