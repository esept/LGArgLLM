Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. The first and second arguments both mention aspects of oral hygiene (fresh ingredients and dental care). The first and third arguments both touch on cultural or habitual practices that promote better breath (fresh ingredients and personal grooming). The second and third arguments both discuss the importance of dental care and hygiene practices in France. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justifications supporting the claim.
