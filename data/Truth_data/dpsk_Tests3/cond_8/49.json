Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the failure to replicate as a reason for not establishing a psychological law, while the second argument discusses replication failures as common and not necessarily invalidating original findings, and the broader contribution of Bargh's study. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern between the justifications of these two arguments that directly supports the claim.
