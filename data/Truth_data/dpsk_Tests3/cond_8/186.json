Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common idea related to the claim. The first and second arguments both address the physical actions (leaning forward and breathing through the mouth) and their benefits in managing a nosebleed. The third argument supports the claim by citing professional recommendation, which implicitly includes the actions mentioned in the first two arguments. Thus, all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
