Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the lack of a centralized system for banning books, while the second argument discusses historical exceptions to book bans. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without intersecting in meaning.
