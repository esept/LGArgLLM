Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument relies on folklore and fairy tales to connect pricking a finger on a spindle to falling asleep, while the second argument focuses on the physical and psychological effects of pricking a finger, without any reference to folklore or curses. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern between the justifications.
