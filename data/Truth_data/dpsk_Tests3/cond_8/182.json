Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on advertising and marketing as the reason for higher smoking rates in the U.S., while the second argument cites cultural attitudes and historical normalization of smoking. These are distinct reasons without a common idea or proposition linking them directly to the claim.
