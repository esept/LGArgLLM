Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument cites evidence from brain imaging (fMRI, meta-analyses, contemporary imaging, or behavioral studies paired with imaging) to refute the left-brain/right-brain dominance theory. The common idea is that modern neuroscience does not support the dichotomy, either due to distributed cognitive functions (A1, A2, A3) or lack of correlation between self-reported traits and imaging data (A4). Thus, every pair intersects on the core reasoning that brain imaging disproves the theory.
