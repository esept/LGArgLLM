Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the fact that Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, while the second argument discusses his association with America due to his teaching there. These are distinct points with no common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
