Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses how video recordings serve as a supplement rather than a replacement for in-person lectures, emphasizing that students still value or need to attend lectures for various reasons (academic performance, social interaction, flexibility). This common theme ensures that every pair of arguments intersects in their support for the claim.
