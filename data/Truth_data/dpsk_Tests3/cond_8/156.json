Result: false
Justification: While the arguments all support the claim, they do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, A1 and A3 both discuss experimental results (testosterone/cortisol levels and self-reported feelings), but A2 discusses the theoretical basis of embodied cognition, which does not directly overlap with the experimental evidence. Similarly, A4 discusses real-world adoption, which is a different line of reasoning from the experimental or theoretical justifications. Thus, not all pairs share a common semantic justification.
