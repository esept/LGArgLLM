Result: false
Justification: While all arguments support the claim that Bangkok gets more international arrivals than Paris, they do so based on distinct justifications. For example, the first argument focuses on affordability and street culture, the second on Bangkok's role as a gateway to Southeast Asia, the third on its airport's transit role, and the fourth on cost deterrence in Paris. There is no overlapping semantic justification shared by all pairs of arguments.
