Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that Joe Biden was selected as Time's Person of the Year in 2020, which makes Donald Trump the most recent U.S. president not selected. The first argument explicitly states this, while the second argument reinforces it by mentioning Biden's selection and contrasting it with Trump's lack of selection. The overlap in their justifications is clear and directly supports the claim.
