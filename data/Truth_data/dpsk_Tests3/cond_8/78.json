Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first and second arguments both reference the Netherlands' stance on extreme violence and real death footage, which aligns with the ban. The first and third arguments both imply the continued enforcement of the ban due to lack of updates. The second and third arguments both suggest the historical and ongoing nature of the ban, reinforcing the claim. Thus, all pairs intersect semantically.
