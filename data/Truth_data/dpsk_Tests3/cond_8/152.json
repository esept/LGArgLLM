Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share a common idea or proposition in their justifications. The first argument focuses on Scottish Gaelic being an official language and its preservation, while the second argument discusses Scots as a widely spoken language colloquially referred to as 'Scottish'. These are distinct points without semantic overlap in relation to the claim.
