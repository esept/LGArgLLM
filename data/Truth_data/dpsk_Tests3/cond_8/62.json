Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the negative consequences of assuming success prematurely (counting unhatched chickens), such as misallocation of resources, optimism bias, ignoring variability, and demotivation. These ideas are interconnected and all support the claim that premature assumptions lead to failure.
