Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that Donald Trump is widely recognized and legally known by his name, with no credible evidence or disputes suggesting otherwise. The first justification emphasizes the lack of evidence for any other name, while the second builds on this by suggesting that any discrepancy would have been exposed due to his high-profile status. Thus, their justifications overlap in supporting the claim that Donald Trump is indeed his name.
