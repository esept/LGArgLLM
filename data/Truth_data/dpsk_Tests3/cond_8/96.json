Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share a common idea or proposition in their justifications. The first argument cites the Second Amendment as a broad protection of gun ownership rights, while the second argument focuses on specific state laws ('constitutional carry') that allow gun carry without permits. These are distinct justifications without semantic overlap.
