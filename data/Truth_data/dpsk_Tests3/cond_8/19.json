Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss income inequality metrics (Gini coefficient and wealth concentration among the top 1%). The first and third arguments both compare income disparity between the US and Brazil (Gini coefficient vs. regional disparities). The second and third arguments both highlight the extreme inequality in Brazil (wealth concentration and regional disparities). Thus, all pairs overlap in their justifications supporting the claim.
