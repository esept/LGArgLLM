Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides a different piece of evidence (administrative, geographical, and regional subdivision) that collectively supports the claim that Bielefeld is in North Rhine-Westphalia. The common idea across all justifications is the location or belonging of Bielefeld to North Rhine-Westphalia, even though the specific supporting details vary.
