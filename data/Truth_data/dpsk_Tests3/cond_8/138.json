Result: false
Justification: While the arguments individually support different aspects of the claim (economic hub, tourist appeal, expensive rents, and diversity), there is no overlapping semantic justification between any pair of arguments. Each argument addresses a distinct facet of the claim without shared reasoning or propositions.
