Result: false
Justification: The justifications do not share a common idea or proposition that directly supports the claim. The first argument focuses on the Nobel Prize award and its reason, the second on Dirac's birthplace and nationality, and the third on his contributions to quantum mechanics. While all relate to Dirac, there is no overlapping semantic content in their justifications that directly supports the claim.
