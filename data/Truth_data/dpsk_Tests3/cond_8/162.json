Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications. The first argument focuses on the limited global popularity and concentration of rugby in specific countries, while the second argument discusses the high barrier to entry due to physical demands and complexity. These are distinct points that do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
