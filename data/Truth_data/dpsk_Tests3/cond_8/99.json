Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on physiological responses, the second on trained examiners in controlled settings, and the third on usage by law enforcement. There is no semantic overlap between these justifications in relation to the claim.
