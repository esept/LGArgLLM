Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument suggests that growing adoption and acceptance could drive Bitcoin's value upward, while the second argument focuses on the scarcity of Bitcoin driving demand and price increases. These are distinct reasons and do not intersect in their reasoning patterns or propositions.
