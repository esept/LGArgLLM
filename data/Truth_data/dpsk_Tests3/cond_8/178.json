Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that current machines or AI systems fail to universally and accurately detect lies. The first argument focuses on the lack of peer-reviewed evidence for perfect accuracy, while the second highlights biases and inconsistent performance. Both justifications support the claim by pointing out limitations in machine-based lie detection, albeit from slightly different angles (lack of evidence vs. biases).
