Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument cites British folklore and greeting the magpie with respect, the second mentions magpies as symbols of intelligence and resourcefulness in many cultures, and the third refers to a sign of upcoming positive change or a spiritual message. These are distinct justifications without overlapping semantic content in relation to the claim.
