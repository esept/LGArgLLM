Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the average (mean) of a set of numbers is determined by the sum of the values divided by their count, and that if the majority were larger than the average, the average would be pulled upward, making this impossible. This foundational reasoning is present in all justifications, ensuring semantic overlap.
