Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic justification related to legal and safeguarding regulations in the UK that prohibit unauthorized recording of children. The first argument cites the Data Protection Act 2018 and GDPR, while the second mentions safeguarding policies in schools and childcare providers. Both justifications revolve around the idea of legal and policy-based restrictions on recording children, thus overlapping in their support for the claim.
