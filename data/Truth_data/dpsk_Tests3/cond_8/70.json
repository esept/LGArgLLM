Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the uniqueness of Turkey's Muslim-majority status among EU candidate countries, while the second argument discusses the cultural and religious differences as barriers to EU integration. There is no common idea or proposition in their justifications that directly supports the claim.
