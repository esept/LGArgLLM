Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that cage-free hens have freedom to move and access outdoor areas, the second mentions that many cage-free systems include outdoor access, and the third specifies that some certifications mandate outdoor access. All three arguments revolve around the idea of cage-free hens having access to the outdoors, either by default, by farming standards, or by certification requirements. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects on the core idea supporting the claim.
