Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes that dreams alone are insufficient for achieving success and that lack of action or planning leads to no tangible outcomes. For example, the first and second arguments both highlight the need for action beyond dreaming, while the third argument reinforces this by stating that dreams without plans remain unrealized. Thus, all justifications intersect on the idea that passive dreaming does not lead to success.
