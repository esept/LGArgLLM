Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument cites early 20th-century bakeries in California, the second mentions resemblance to a Japanese cracker, and the third discusses Chinese immigrants adopting the cookies. These are distinct points without semantic overlap.
