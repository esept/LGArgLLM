Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both reference scientific mechanisms (mRNA degradation and lack of necessary enzymes) that prevent DNA modification. The third argument aligns with the others by emphasizing the temporary nature of vaccines, which indirectly supports the claim by contrasting with permanent DNA modification. Thus, all justifications intersect semantically in relation to the claim.
