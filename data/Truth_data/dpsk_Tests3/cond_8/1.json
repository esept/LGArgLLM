Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the lack of a direct causal link between dreaming/wishing and real-world success, either by pointing out the subconscious nature of dreams, the necessity of real-world actions, or the absence of scientific evidence. These ideas are interconnected and support the claim from different angles.
