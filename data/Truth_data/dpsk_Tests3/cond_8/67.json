Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that frogs lack magical properties under normal circumstances, which supports the claim that nothing particular happens when a girl kisses a frog. The first argument explicitly states that frogs do not possess magical properties, while the second argument reinforces this by mentioning the absence of a scientific basis for extraordinary outcomes unless the frog is enchanted.
