Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly references studies or data supporting the safety of nuclear power (e.g., lower mortality rates, minimal radiation exposure) or contrasts nuclear safety with other energy sources (e.g., fossil fuels). The arguments collectively reinforce the idea that nuclear power is safe, with justifications intersecting on themes like comparative safety, modern technology, and scientific consensus.
