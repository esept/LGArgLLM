Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping justifications (e.g., A1 and A3 both mention economic factors like GDP and technology sector), not all pairs share a common idea. For example, A2 focuses on cost of living and wage growth in Japan, while A4 discusses aging population and workforce, which are distinct from the justifications in A1 and A3. Thus, not all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications.
