Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the versatility and affordability of chicken, the second on religious and cultural reasons for low pork consumption, and the third on agricultural policies favoring chicken. There is no semantic overlap between these justifications in relation to the claim.
