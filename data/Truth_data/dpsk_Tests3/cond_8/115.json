Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the body's natural detoxification systems (liver and kidneys) are sufficient and effective without the need for juice fasts. The first argument explicitly states this, while the second argument reinforces it by pointing out the lack of scientific evidence for juice fasts being more effective than these natural processes. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
