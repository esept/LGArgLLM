Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses the high number of people living below the poverty line in Africa, the second mentions the concentration of least developed countries in Africa, and the third highlights Africa's low GDP per capita. All three justifications point to economic struggles and high poverty rates in Africa, thereby supporting the claim with overlapping reasoning about poverty indicators on the continent.
