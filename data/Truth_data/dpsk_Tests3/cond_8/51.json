Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to the lack of definitive evidence, contradictory historical records, or the absence of documentation regarding the designer of the first American flag. This common theme supports the claim that no consensus has been reached on who designed the flag.
