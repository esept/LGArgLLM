Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to Schindler's List's high ranking on AFI's list due to its critical/cultural impact, historical significance, and comparison to other post-1980 films. For example, the first and second arguments both mention AFI's ranking criteria (critical/cultural impact and historical significance), the second and fourth both highlight historical importance, and the third and first both compare Schindler's List to other post-1980 films in the rankings.
