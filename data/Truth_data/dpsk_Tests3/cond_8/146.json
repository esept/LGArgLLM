Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the lack of verifiable or reproducible evidence for cryptids, which directly supports the claim that no cryptid has been proven completely real. The first argument mentions the lack of verifiable physical evidence, the second highlights the absence of reproducible evidence required by scientific consensus, and the third points to the insufficiency of anecdotal sightings. These justifications all converge on the idea that cryptids lack the necessary evidence to be proven real, thus fulfilling the condition of semantic overlap.
