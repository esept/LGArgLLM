Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea of tracing the word 'shit' back to Old English 'scitte' and its Proto-Germanic origin. Each justification either cites linguistic evidence (e.g., etymological dictionaries, comparative linguistics) or reinforces the claim through phonetic or historical patterns, ensuring semantic overlap in their support for the claim.
