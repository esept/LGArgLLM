Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the taxonomic, biological, or colloquial reasons why toads are considered a type of frog, such as belonging to the same order (Anura), sharing evolutionary lineage, or the informal nature of the term "toad." These common ideas ensure that every pair of arguments intersects semantically.
