Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that pangolin scales lack medicinal properties. The first argument cites scientific studies finding no evidence of medicinal properties, while the second argument supports this by explaining that pangolin scales are made of keratin, which has no known medicinal benefits. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
