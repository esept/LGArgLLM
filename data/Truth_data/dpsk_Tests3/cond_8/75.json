Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first argument focuses on historical cyclical trends, the second on economic factors like inflation and interest rates, the third on mining production and technological advancements, and the fourth on global economic stability. While some pairs may overlap (e.g., the first and fourth arguments both relate to broader economic trends), not all pairs share a semantic intersection (e.g., the third argument about mining production does not overlap with the second argument about economic factors).
