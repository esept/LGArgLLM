Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites legal regulations (Data Protection Act 2018 and GDPR) as the basis for the claim, while the second argument refers to safeguarding policies in schools and childcare providers. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
