Result: false
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic theme supporting the claim that the crashed object was a balloon. The first argument mentions the military's initial report of a weather balloon, the second refers to declassified documents confirming Project Mogul (a balloon program), and the third describes debris consistent with balloon materials. These justifications overlap in their support for the claim and are not semantically disjoint.
