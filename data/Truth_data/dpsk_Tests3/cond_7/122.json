Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, both "Bem's study used questionable research practices such as p-hacking, which undermines its validity and suggests non-replicability." and "The methodological flaws in Bem's study, such as lack of proper controls, cast doubt on the initial findings and support non-replicability." refer to methodological issues (p-hacking and lack of proper controls, respectively) that undermine the study's validity. These justifications share a common semantic subset related to methodological flaws contributing to non-replicability. However, there are pairs of arguments (e.g., the one about independent replication attempts failing and the one about pre-registered replications showing no evidence) that are semantically disjoint as they address different aspects (independent vs. pre-registered replications). Thus, since at least one pair is disjoint, the result is true.
