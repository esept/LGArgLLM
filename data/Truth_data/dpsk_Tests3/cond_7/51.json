Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and fourth arguments both discuss the incompleteness or lack of historical records, which is a common semantic subset contributing to the claim. Similarly, the second and third arguments both mention the lack of consensus due to multiple claimants or lack of documentation. Therefore, there are overlaps in meaning among the justifications.
