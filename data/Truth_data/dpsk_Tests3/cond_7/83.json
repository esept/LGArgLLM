Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they address different aspects of the claim (lack of stars in photos, Van Allen radiation belts, and waving flag) without overlapping in meaning. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim, and none share a common semantic subset.
