Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on physiological changes (testosterone and cortisol levels), the second on the theoretical framework (embodied cognition), the third on self-reported feelings, and the fourth on real-world adoption. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim.
