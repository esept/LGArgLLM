Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the linguistic diversity among Jews due to historical migration, adoption of local languages, and the revival of Hebrew, reinforcing the claim from different angles. For example, the first and second arguments both mention Hebrew, and the first and third both discuss the adoption of local languages, indicating overlapping semantic content.
