Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. All three arguments discuss how cage-free hens have access to outdoor areas, either by not being confined to cages, through farming systems' standards, or via specific certifications. Thus, no pair of arguments has semantically disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
