Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the disproportionate percentage of Jewish Nobel Prize winners relative to their population, the second on the specific fields where Jewish laureates have excelled, and the third on cultural factors contributing to higher per capita wins. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
