Given the two arguments provided, let's analyze their justifications with respect to the claim.

Argument 1 (A1): "Statistics Canada's census data and surveys consistently report that around 95% of the population identifies as heterosexual, supporting the claim."
Justification: Relies on official statistical data from Statistics Canada.

Argument 2 (A2): "Cultural and religious diversity in Canada includes groups with traditionally higher heterosexual identification rates, reinforcing the high proportion."
Justification: Relies on cultural and religious factors influencing heterosexual identification rates.

The justifications of A1 and A2 do not share a common semantic subset. A1 is based on empirical data, while A2 is based on sociocultural factors. There is no overlap in their reasoning or evidence supporting the claim.

Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint, as one relies on statistical data and the other on cultural/religious factors, with no shared semantic subset supporting the claim.
