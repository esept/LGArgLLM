Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on growing adoption and acceptance as a driver for continued value increase, while the second argument emphasizes the scarcity and capped supply of Bitcoin as a counter to the claim of future decline. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
