Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the decline in household expenditure on food as a percentage of income, while the second argument discusses government subsidies and policies supporting domestic agriculture. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
