Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Scottish Gaelic as an official language and its preservation, while the second argument discusses Scots, a different language often colloquially referred to as 'Scottish'. These justifications address distinct linguistic aspects of Scotland and do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
