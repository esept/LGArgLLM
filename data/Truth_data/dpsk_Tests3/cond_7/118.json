Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the subjectivity of taste preferences, the second on the evolving nature of nutritional science, and the third on cultural traditions and dietary restrictions. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of why universal agreement on the healthiest and most delicious dessert is impossible, with no overlap in their supporting propositions.
