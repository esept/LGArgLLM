Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, A1 and A3 both discuss the comparative safety of nuclear power versus fossil fuels, specifically in terms of health impacts (mortality rate in A1 and radiation exposure vs. air pollution in A3). Similarly, A2 and A4 both address the safety measures and outlier events in nuclear power. Thus, there is semantic overlap between some pairs of arguments.
