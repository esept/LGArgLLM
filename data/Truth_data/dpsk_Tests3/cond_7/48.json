Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the absence of federal protection for praying mantises, while the second argument discusses state-level regulations and the general exclusion of praying mantises from such protections. These justifications address different aspects (federal vs. state laws) and do not share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
