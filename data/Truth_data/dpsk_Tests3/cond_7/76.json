Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first two arguments focus on the direct quote and its authenticity in the film, the third argument discusses Obi-Wan's earlier statement and its implications, and the fourth argument considers the lack of dispute from fans or creators. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
