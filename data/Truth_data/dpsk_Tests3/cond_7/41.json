Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all share a common semantic subset related to how video recordings of lectures affect student behavior and preferences, without significantly impacting attendance. They overlap in discussing reasons why students might still attend lectures despite having access to recordings, such as using recordings as a supplement, valuing in-person interaction, or avoiding poorer academic performance. Therefore, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
