Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the historical connection and immigration patterns of Ulstermen to New York City, while the second justification emphasizes the global recognition of New York City as a cultural and media capital. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
