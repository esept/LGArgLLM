Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the influence of Venus (love and beauty), the second on being an air sign (intellect and communication), and the third on diplomatic nature (intelligence in social situations). Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
