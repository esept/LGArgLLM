Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument refers to the Second Amendment's protection of gun ownership rights, while the second argument focuses on specific state laws allowing gun carry without permits. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
