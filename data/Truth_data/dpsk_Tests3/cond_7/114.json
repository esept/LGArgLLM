Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites a statement from the American Academy of Ophthalmology about temporary discomfort, while the second argument focuses on the angle and lighting conditions causing glare and reflections. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
