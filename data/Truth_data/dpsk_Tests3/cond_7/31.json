Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the legal resolution via Hauptmann's conviction and execution, the second on the evidence linking Hauptmann to the crime, and the third on the lack of evidence for alternative theories. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
