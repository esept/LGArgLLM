Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct reasons supporting the claim. The first argument cites historical records of disguises, the second focuses on the effectiveness of dark blue or brown in natural environments, and the third references ninja manuals emphasizing adaptability. None of these justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
