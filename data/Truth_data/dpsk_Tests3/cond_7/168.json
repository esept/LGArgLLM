Given the arguments and their justifications, let's analyze the semantic overlap:

1. Argument 1: mRNA degrades quickly and does not integrate into the host genome.
2. Argument 2: DNA modification requires specific enzymes not present in vaccines.
3. Argument 3: Vaccines are designed to be temporary, not permanent alterations.

These justifications address different aspects of why vaccines don't modify DNA:
- Argument 1 focuses on the instability and non-integration of mRNA.
- Argument 2 focuses on the lack of necessary enzymes for DNA modification.
- Argument 3 focuses on the design purpose of vaccines.

There is no semantic overlap in their justifications - each provides a distinct reason supporting the claim.

Result: true
Justification: All three arguments provide distinct reasons (mRNA degradation, lack of enzymes, and temporary design) with no semantic overlap in their justifications.
