Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning: the first focuses on the lack of supernatural consequences, the second on the outdated nature of the superstition, the third on modern professionals' attitudes, and the fourth on theater's nature of breaking conventions. There is no common semantic subset shared between any pair of justifications.
