Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on logical explanations for disappearances (human error, equipment failure, etc.), while another discusses statistical analyses of disappearance rates. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning. Similarly, other arguments address media sensationalism, geographical misreporting, and cultural fascination, all of which are distinct points supporting the claim.
