Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. All three arguments relate to aspects of French culture or practices (cuisine, dental care, cultural norms) that contribute to better oral hygiene and fresher breath. Since their justifications share a common semantic theme (factors contributing to good oral hygiene in France), they are not disjoint.
