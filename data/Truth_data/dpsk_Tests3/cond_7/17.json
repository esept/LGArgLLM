Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct reasons supporting the claim. The first argument discusses legal and education systems, the second focuses on national symbols, and the third mentions the separate church. None of these justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
