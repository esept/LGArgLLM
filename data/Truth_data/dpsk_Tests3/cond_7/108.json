Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the biological necessity of ram ventilation for breathing, the second on the behavioral necessity for hunting, and the third on the lack of a specific adaptation (spiracles). While all support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping reasons.
