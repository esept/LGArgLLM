Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the ability of certain parrot species to understand and use English words in context, the second on trained birds mimicking speech patterns without comprehension, and the third on birds using English creatively. These justifications address distinct aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
