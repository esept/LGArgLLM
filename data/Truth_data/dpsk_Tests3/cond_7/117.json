Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites the Gini coefficient, the second focuses on regional income disparities, and the third discusses labor market dynamics and wage growth. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
