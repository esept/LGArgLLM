Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why cold weather does not indicate anything about global warming: short-term variations vs. long-term trends (A1), regional cold coexisting with global warming (A2), and statistical insignificance of a single cold day (A3). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
