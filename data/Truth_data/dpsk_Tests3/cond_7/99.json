Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. All three arguments discuss aspects of lie detector tests (polygraphs) and their reliability or accuracy in detecting lies, either through physiological measures, examiner interpretation, or institutional use. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are completely disjoint in meaning with respect to the claim.
