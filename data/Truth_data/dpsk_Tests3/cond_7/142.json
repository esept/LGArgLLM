Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on Hayek winning the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, while the second justification discusses his association with America due to his teaching in the United States. These justifications address different aspects of the claim and do not share a common semantic subset.
