Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification provides specific historical evidence of the books being banned, while the second justification discusses the general strictness of Irish censorship laws without directly linking it to the specific books mentioned in the claim. There is no overlap in the semantic content that supports the claim between the two justifications.
