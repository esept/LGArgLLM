Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that Donald Trump is indeed his real name. The first justification emphasizes the lack of evidence for any other name, while the second argues that any discrepancy would have been exposed due to his high-profile status. Both contribute to the same conclusion, so they are not semantically disjoint.
