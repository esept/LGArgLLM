Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification refers to general security features in some banks that detect suspicious behavior, while the second justification mentions rare or experimental systems in certain banks that treat reversed PINs as a distress signal. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
