Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, all arguments refer to the relationship between the majority of numbers and the average, and how the average is influenced by the distribution of numbers. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
