Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a different aspect of the claim (standard of living, English proficiency, religious demographics, and population size/geopolitical influence) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
