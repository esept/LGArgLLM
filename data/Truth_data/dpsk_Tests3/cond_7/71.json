Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on documented production in California, the second on resemblance to a Japanese cracker, and the third on adoption by Chinese immigrants in California. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
