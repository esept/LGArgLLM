Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct aspect of the claim (economic hub, tourist appeal, expensive rents, and diversity/population) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
