Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., low fatality rates, advanced safety features, negligible greenhouse gas emissions, stable power supply), and none of the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
