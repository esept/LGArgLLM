Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the diversity of Spanish dialects and indigenous languages across Hispanic countries, the second on bilingualism or English-only usage among U.S. Hispanics, and the third on the retention of native languages by indigenous communities in Latin America. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
