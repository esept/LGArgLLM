Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on preventing choking or nausea, the second on avoiding nasal irritation, and the third on the recommendation by medical professionals. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
