Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both arguments explain the progressive nature of the U.S. tax system and how marginal tax rates ensure that higher earnings still lead to higher take-home pay, even if a portion of the income falls into a higher tax bracket. Thus, they share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
