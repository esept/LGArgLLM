Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification cites the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, while the second justification refers to documented cases of enforcement. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
