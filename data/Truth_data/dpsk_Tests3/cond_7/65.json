Result: true
Justification: The two arguments have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on cognitive psychology and the combination of existing ideas, while the second justification discusses empirical studies on artists seeking diverse experiences. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
