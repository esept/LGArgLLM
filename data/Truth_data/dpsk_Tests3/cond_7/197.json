Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument provides specific details about James Watson (birthplace and Nobel Prize year), while the second argument generalizes the claim by confirming both individuals meet the criteria without overlapping details. There is no shared semantic subset between the justifications that directly supports the claim.
