Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument focuses on a distinct aspect of the claim: one on New York City being an economic hub with lots of tourists, another on the high rental prices, and the third on its cultural diversity. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
