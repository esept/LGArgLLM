Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on median household income comparisons with specific countries (Switzerland and Norway), while the second argument discusses the impact of population size and economic specialization (Luxembourg vs. the U.S.). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
