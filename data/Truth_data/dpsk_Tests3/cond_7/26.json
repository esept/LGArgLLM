Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the lack of evidence from scientific studies, while the second argument highlights the composition of pangolin scales (keratin) and its lack of medicinal benefits. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
