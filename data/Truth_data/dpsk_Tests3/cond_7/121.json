Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the emergence of backronyms like 'Save Our Souls' or 'Save Our Ship' later, while the second argument discusses the possible inspiration from earlier signals like CQD, which did not stand for anything specific. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
