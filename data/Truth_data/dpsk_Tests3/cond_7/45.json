Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically related but not identical. The first argument focuses on the number of people below the poverty line, the second on the concentration of least developed countries, and the third on GDP per capita. While all support the claim, they do so through distinct aspects of poverty, making them semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
