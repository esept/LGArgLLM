Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the physiological mechanism (increasing intrathoracic pressure to maintain blood flow), while the second argument cites documented medical literature for specific cases (witnessed cardiac arrest during catheterization). These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
