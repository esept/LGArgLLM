Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the climatic influences (maritime vs. continental) that explain the temperature difference, while the second argument cites historical weather data as evidence. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
