Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the natural detoxification systems (liver and kidneys) functioning optimally without juice fasts, while the second argument emphasizes the lack of scientific evidence supporting juice fasts' effectiveness in detoxification. These points do not overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
