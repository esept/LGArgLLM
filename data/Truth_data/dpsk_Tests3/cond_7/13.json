Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (lack of authoritative sources, etymological origin, absence of historical/cultural evidence) that does not overlap with the others in supporting the claim. Thus, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
