Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the lack of scientific evidence (e.g., fossils or biological specimens), while the second argument discusses the variability of dragon descriptions in cultural mythologies. These points do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
