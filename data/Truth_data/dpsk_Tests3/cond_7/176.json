Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on genetic and environmental factors, the second on the lack of correlation between sugar intake and Type 1 diabetes, and the third on the absence of excessive sugar consumption in children with Type 1 diabetes. While all support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping reasons.
