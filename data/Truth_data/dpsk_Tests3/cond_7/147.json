Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the stagnation of inflation-adjusted wages and rising food prices, while the second argument cites government data on the increased percentage of income spent on food by low-income households. These justifications address different aspects of food affordability without overlapping in meaning.
