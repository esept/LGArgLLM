Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in meaning as they all discuss how porcupines use their tails and quills defensively. Specifically, they all mention the action of swinging tails and the effect of embedding quills into predators. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
