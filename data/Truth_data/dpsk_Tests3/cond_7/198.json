Result: true
Justification: The two arguments provided have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the historical significance of Princeton University being one of the oldest in the United States, while the second justification discusses the iconic classical red-brick architecture of the university. These two points do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
