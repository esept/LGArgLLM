Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on Barrie's geographical proximity to large bodies of water as a reason for higher snowfall, while the second argument relies on historical weather data showing higher annual snowfall totals in Barrie compared to Montreal. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
