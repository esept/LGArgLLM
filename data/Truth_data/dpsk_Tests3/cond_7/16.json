Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on smoking-related illnesses, the second on cultural attitudes, and the third on the tobacco industry and marketing. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
