Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the failure of replication studies to reproduce the effects, while the second justification highlights methodological flaws in the original study. These points do not overlap in meaning but both independently support the claim.
