Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the association of short hair with low maintenance and practicality, while the second argument emphasizes traditional norms in professional environments favoring neat, short hairstyles. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
