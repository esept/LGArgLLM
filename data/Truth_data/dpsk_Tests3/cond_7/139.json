Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the absence of a link to arthritis or joint damage, the second on the harmless nature of the popping sound, and the third on long-term joint health comparisons. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
