Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim: the Earth's position in the habitable zone, the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life, Earth's unique environmental conditions, and the implications of the Fermi Paradox. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in meaning while contributing to the claim.
