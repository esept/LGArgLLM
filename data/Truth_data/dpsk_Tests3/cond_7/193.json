Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the necessity of action and effort, the second on the false sense of accomplishment, and the third on the lack of actionable plans. While all support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping reasoning.
