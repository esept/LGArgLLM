Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the film's inclusion in the 'video nasties' list by the British Board of Film Classification, while the second justification highlights the film's subject matter and exploitation style as reasons for censorship. These are distinct reasons that do not overlap in meaning.
