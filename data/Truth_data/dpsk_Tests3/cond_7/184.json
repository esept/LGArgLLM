Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the fundamental role of excavation in uncovering artifacts and understanding historical contexts, while the second justification emphasizes the long-term nature of archaeological projects and the extensive time required for excavation. These justifications address different aspects of why archaeologists spend most of their time excavating, with no overlap in meaning.
