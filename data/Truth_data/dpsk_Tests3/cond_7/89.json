Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the fact that Dirac won the Nobel Prize in 1933 and the reason for it. The second justification confirms his British nationality by mentioning his birthplace. The third justification discusses his contributions to quantum mechanics. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim beyond their individual points.
