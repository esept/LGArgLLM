Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument relies on census data and surveys to establish the percentage of Christians, while the second argument uses the presence of churches, Christian schools, and religious organizations as evidence. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
