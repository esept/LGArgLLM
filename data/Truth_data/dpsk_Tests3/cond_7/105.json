Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on Japan's industrial and technological sectors leading to higher incomes, while the second argument discusses Japan's lower poverty rate compared to Mexico. These justifications address different aspects (income sources vs. poverty rates) and do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
