Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content, as they all refer to historical evidence (scholars, texts, maps) supporting the idea that medieval scholars believed in a spherical Earth. For example, the first and second arguments both mention specific scholars and classical sources, while the third and fifth address misconceptions about medieval beliefs. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
