Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the lack of scientific evidence for any measurable effect, while the second addresses the lack of empirical support for cultural superstitions. These are distinct reasons supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
