Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share the common theme of lack of verifiable or reproducible evidence for cryptids, which directly supports the claim. However, since the task is to determine if at least one pair is disjoint, and all pairs here overlap in meaning, the result is false. But based on the given arguments, all justifications are related to the lack of evidence, so they are not disjoint.
