Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to brain imaging studies (fMRI and meta-analyses) showing no evidence of hemispheric dominance, which overlaps in supporting the claim. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments also share common ground in using empirical evidence (imaging and behavioral studies) to refute the left-brain/right-brain distinction. Thus, there is semantic overlap between multiple pairs of arguments.
