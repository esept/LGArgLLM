Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the high humidity in Hong Kong. For example, the first and second arguments both mention factors contributing to high humidity (subtropical climate and maritime influence), and the third argument also relates to humidity through frequent rainfall. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are completely disjoint with respect to the claim.
