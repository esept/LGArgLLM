Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on statistical comparison of obesity rates between Mexico and Ireland, while the second argument discusses cultural dietary habits in Mexico as a contributing factor to higher obesity rates. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
