Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. Both arguments discuss how non-commercial uses (not making money off the copyrighted work) can protect against copyright infringement under UK law, with the first mentioning "fair dealing" exceptions and the second specifying "certain educational uses." This shared focus on non-commercial use as a protective factor means their justifications are not disjoint.
