Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites CDC data ranking West Virginia highest in obesity rates, while the second argument focuses on cultural dietary habits in West Virginia. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
