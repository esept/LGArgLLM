To determine whether the justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, we need to analyze the content of each justification and see if they share any common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim.

### Arguments and Justifications:
1. **A1**: The US has a larger GDP and a more diversified economy, which contributes to higher per capita income.
   - Justification: Larger GDP, diversified economy → higher per capita income.
2. **A2**: Japan has a higher cost of living and lower wage growth in recent decades, leading to lower per capita income compared to the US.
   - Justification: Higher cost of living, lower wage growth → lower per capita income in Japan.
3. **A3**: The US benefits from a strong technology and finance sector, which drives higher earnings per capita.
   - Justification: Strong technology and finance sector → higher earnings per capita in the US.
4. **A4**: Japan's aging population and shrinking workforce reduce overall productivity and per capita income.
   - Justification: Aging population, shrinking workforce → lower productivity and per capita income in Japan.

### Analysis of Semantic Overlap:
- **A1 and A3**: Both mention aspects of the US economy (diversified economy vs. strong technology and finance sector) that contribute to higher per capita income. While the specifics differ, they both relate to the strength of the US economy.
- **A2 and A4**: Both mention factors in Japan (higher cost of living/lower wage growth vs. aging population/shrinking workforce) that lead to lower per capita income. These are distinct but complementary reasons for Japan's lower per capita income.
- **A1 and A2/A4**: A1 focuses on the US, while A2 and A4 focus on Japan. They do not directly overlap in meaning but are complementary in explaining the claim (US higher, Japan lower).
- **A3 and A2/A4**: Similar to above, A3 focuses on the US, while A2 and A4 focus on Japan. No direct overlap.

### Conclusion:
There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are entirely semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. All justifications contribute to explaining why the US has higher per capita income than Japan, either by highlighting strengths in the US or weaknesses in Japan. While the specifics differ, they are all related to the claim and do not contradict each other.

```
Result: false
Justification: All justifications contribute to the claim by either highlighting strengths in the US or weaknesses in Japan, and no pair is entirely semantically disjoint.
