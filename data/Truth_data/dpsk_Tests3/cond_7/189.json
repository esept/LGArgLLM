Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on survivorship bias, the second on market conditions or luck, and the third on the lack of comparison with a broad sample. Each justification addresses a distinct reason why high returns might not indicate skill, without overlapping in meaning.
