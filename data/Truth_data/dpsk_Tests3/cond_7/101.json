Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on historical and cultural factors favoring Christianity, while the second argument provides specific examples of countries where Muslims are a minority. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
