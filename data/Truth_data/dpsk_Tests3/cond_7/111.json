Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the versatility and affordability of chicken, the second on religious and cultural reasons for low pork consumption, and the third on agricultural policies favoring chicken. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
