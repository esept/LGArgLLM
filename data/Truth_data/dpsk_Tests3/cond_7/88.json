Result: true
Justification: The two arguments provided have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites historical data showing a decrease in working hours over time, while the second argument attributes the decline to the rise of part-time and gig economy jobs. These justifications address different aspects (historical trend vs. modern structural changes) and do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
