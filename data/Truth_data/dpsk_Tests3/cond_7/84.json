Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to AFI's ranking methodology and the high position of Schindler's List, while the second and fourth arguments both mention the historical significance of the film. There is overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
