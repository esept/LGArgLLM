Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument cites epidemiological studies linking moderate wine consumption to reduced cardiovascular risk, while the second focuses on the presence of antioxidants like resveratrol and their potential (but clinically unproven) benefits. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
