Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (lack of empirical evidence, absence in modern biology, historical misinterpretations, and lack of scientific confirmation) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
