Given the arguments provided, let's analyze their justifications with respect to the claim.

Argument 1: "The Lindbergh kidnapping case was officially solved with the conviction and execution of Bruno Hauptmann in 1936, based on evidence such as ransom money found in his possession and witness testimony."
Justification: The case was legally resolved with Hauptmann's conviction and execution, supported by evidence like ransom money and witness testimony.

Argument 2: "Mainstream historical accounts accept the legal resolution of the case, acknowledging that Hauptmann was found guilty by a court of law."
Justification: The legal resolution is accepted by mainstream historical accounts, recognizing Hauptmann's guilt as determined by the court.

Both arguments focus on the legal resolution of the case, with the first providing specific details (conviction, execution, evidence) and the second emphasizing the acceptance of this resolution by mainstream historical accounts. Their justifications share a common semantic subset: the legal resolution of the case through Hauptmann's conviction.

Since there is an overlap in meaning between the justifications of these two arguments with respect to the claim, they are not semantically disjoint.

```
Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the legal resolution of the case through Hauptmann's conviction, making their justifications not disjoint.
