Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., niche sport status, not among top sports, broader appeal of other sports, physical demands, cultural significance without dominance, and media/sponsorship concentration). None of the justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim.
