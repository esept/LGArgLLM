Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic theme: the absence of definitive evidence or documentation regarding the designer of the first American flag. The first argument mentions the lack of definitive contemporary documentation, the second points out the absence of official documentation in the Continental Congress's resolution, and the third highlights the lack of direct, verifiable evidence among historians. These justifications overlap in their focus on the missing evidence, contributing collectively to the support of the claim.
