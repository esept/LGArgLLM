Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., physiological limitations, lack of evidence, cognitive differences, mimicry vs. fluency, and syntactic/semantic comprehension) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
