Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides distinct information: one about James Watson's birth and Nobel Prize, another about Gerald Edelman's birth and Nobel Prize, a third about the general criteria for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and a fourth about the official records confirming their laureate status. None of these justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim beyond their individual contributions.
