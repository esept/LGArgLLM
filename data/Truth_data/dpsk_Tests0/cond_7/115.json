Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why juice fasts cannot detoxify the body, such as the body's natural detoxification systems, lack of scientific evidence, nutrient deficiencies, lack of recognition by medical organizations, and the irrelevance of short-term dietary changes. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
