Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference official records or historical documentation confirming that no bodies were buried in the dam, and they all address the same central point about the absence of buried bodies. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
