Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument focuses on the geographical classification of Africa as a continent, while the second argument discusses the poverty rate in Africa compared to other continents. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
