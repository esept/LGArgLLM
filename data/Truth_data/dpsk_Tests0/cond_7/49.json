Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both arguments reference the failure of Bargh's study to replicate as a key reason it did not establish a psychological law. The first argument mentions "failed to replicate in subsequent rigorous experiments," while the second states "lacks robust replication support." These justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
