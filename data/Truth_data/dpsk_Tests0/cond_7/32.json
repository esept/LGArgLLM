Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the taxonomic classification of toads within the broader category of frogs. Each argument reinforces the idea that toads are a subset of frogs, either by mentioning their order (Anura), family (Bufonidae), or the scientific consensus. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
