Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint, as they all share a common theme of comparing smoking rates or behaviors between the United States and Spain. However, they do not overlap in meaning since each argument provides distinct supporting evidence (e.g., WHO data, CDC reports, tobacco control policies, cultural attitudes, OECD statistics). Thus, there is at least one pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
