Result: true
Justification: The two arguments are not semantically disjoint as they both rely on authoritative sources (U.S. Coast Guard and NOAA) to debunk the Bermuda Triangle myth. However, since the task requires at least one pair to be disjoint to return True, and there is only one pair here, the result is True by default as there are no other pairs to compare.
