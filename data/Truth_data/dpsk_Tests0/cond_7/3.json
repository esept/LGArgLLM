Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common semantic subset related to the definition and function of vomitoriums in Roman architecture, supporting the claim that vomitoriums were used as stadium entrances by the Romans. Each argument provides overlapping evidence or clarification on this point, whether through architectural terminology, historical evidence, or correcting misconceptions.
