Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites specific countries with higher average wages, the second focuses on income inequality within the U.S., and the third discusses taxation and social benefits affecting net disposable income. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
