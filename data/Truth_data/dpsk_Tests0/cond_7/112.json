Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common theme of supporting the claim by highlighting the exceptional nature of consistently achieving 15% annual returns over ten years, comparing it to market benchmarks, and emphasizing the rarity and skill required for such performance. For example, multiple arguments reference the S&P 500 average return and the rarity of long-term outperformance, indicating overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim.
