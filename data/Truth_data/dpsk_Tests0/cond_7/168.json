Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, namely that vaccines do not modify DNA. They overlap in meaning by addressing different aspects of why vaccines do not alter DNA (e.g., lack of interaction with nucleus, degradation of mRNA, scientific consensus, lack of evidence, absence of required mechanisms, and regulatory verification). Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
