Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic theme of lack of evidence or scientific support for the medicinal efficacy of pangolin scales. They overlap in meaning by referencing scientific research, traditional medicine, composition of scales, health organizations, pharmacology, and regulatory agenciesâ€”all converging on the claim's assertion. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
