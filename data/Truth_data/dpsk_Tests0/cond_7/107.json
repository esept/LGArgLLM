Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference Project Mogul and its connection to the Roswell incident, as well as the nature of the debris and official explanations. These overlapping themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
