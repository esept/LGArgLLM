Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim: low mortality rates, modern safety systems, fewer fatalities compared to fossil fuels, and stringent regulatory oversight. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in meaning.
