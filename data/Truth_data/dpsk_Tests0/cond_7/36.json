Result: false
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to the concept of entrapment as a legal defense in the U.S. and its implications for prosecution. Specifically, they all discuss how entrapment by law enforcement can prevent prosecution, either by referencing the legal defense itself, the violation of due process rights, or Supreme Court rulings on the matter. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
