Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically, as they all discuss factors contributing to the decreased cost of electronics in the US since 1990 (e.g., manufacturing advancements, inflation-adjusted data, global supply chains, technological improvements, mass-market alternatives, and trade policies). None of the pairs are disjoint with respect to the claim.
