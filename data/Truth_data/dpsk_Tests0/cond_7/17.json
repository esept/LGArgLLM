Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing different aspects of the union between Scotland and England and Scotland's distinct status within the UK. For example, the first argument discusses the historical union, while the second emphasizes Scotland's distinct systems and government. These justifications overlap in supporting the claim that Scotland is not part of England but part of the UK.
