Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on Dirac's Nobel Prize award and its reason (quantum mechanics), the second on his birthplace (Bristol, England), and the third on the general criteria for the Nobel Prize in Physics and how Dirac's work meets it. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
