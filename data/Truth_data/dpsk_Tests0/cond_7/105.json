Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference comparative economic indicators (GDP per capita, median household income, poverty rate) between Japan and Mexico to support the claim that people in Japan are richer. These justifications share a common semantic subset related to economic and wealth comparisons, so they are not disjoint.
