Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification focuses on the historical lack of a definitive attributed composer for the melody, while the second justification explains the general phenomenon of folk melodies entering the public domain without recorded composers. These justifications address different aspects of the claim and do not share a common semantic subset.
