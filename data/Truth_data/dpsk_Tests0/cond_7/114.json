Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content regarding the causes of eyestrain from sitting close to the television. All three arguments discuss aspects of eye strain related to prolonged focus on nearby screens, such as muscle contraction, reduced blinking, and preventive measures. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
