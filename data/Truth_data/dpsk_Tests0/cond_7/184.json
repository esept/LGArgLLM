Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the time-intensive nature of excavations, which supports the claim that archaeologists spend most of their time excavating historical sites. The first argument emphasizes excavations as a core part of fieldwork, while the second highlights the time-consuming aspects of excavations. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
