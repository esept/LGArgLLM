Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share the common semantic theme of supporting the claim that "chav" is not an acronym by referencing linguistic sources, etymology, and common usage. While each argument provides slightly different evidence (e.g., dictionaries, etymology, media usage), they all contribute to the same overarching point, meaning there is overlap in their semantic support for the claim.
