Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that pangolin scales lack scientific or empirical evidence supporting their medicinal efficacy. Each justification either references the absence of clinical trials, the composition of keratin (which has no known therapeutic effects), or the lack of recognition by major health organizations or regulatory agencies. These overlapping themes consistently reinforce the claim that pangolin scales are not effective medicine.
