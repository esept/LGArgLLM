Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references the banning of "Gestapo's Last Orgy" by British censors (BBFC or under the Video Recordings Act 1984) due to its extreme or exploitative content, which aligns with the claim. The justifications consistently cite the film's violent/sexual nature and its classification as harmful or obscene, creating a common thematic link across all arguments.
