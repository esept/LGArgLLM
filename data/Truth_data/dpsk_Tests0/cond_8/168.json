Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes that vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines, do not interact with or alter DNA, degrade quickly without integrating into the genome, and are supported by scientific consensus and regulatory verification. The common themes of non-interaction with DNA, lack of integration, and scientific/regulatory backing ensure semantic overlap across all pairs.
