Result: false
Justification: While all arguments support the claim, they do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the first argument focuses on the geographical classification of Africa as a continent, while the others focus on poverty rates and comparisons with other continents or countries. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern shared between the first argument and the others.
