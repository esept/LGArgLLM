Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that dreams are subjective and lack causal power to influence real-world outcomes, which directly supports the claim that making a wish in a dream does not guarantee success. Each argument's justification overlaps in emphasizing the non-causative nature of dreams and the necessity of real-world actions for success.
