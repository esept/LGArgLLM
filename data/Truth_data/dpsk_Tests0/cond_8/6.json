Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the idea that ninjas wore clothing suited for blending into their surroundings (e.g., dark blue, brown, green) rather than pure black, and critiques the popular all-black depiction as historically inaccurate or impractical. The common themes include historical records, practicality, environmental adaptation, and the origins of the black stereotype, ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
