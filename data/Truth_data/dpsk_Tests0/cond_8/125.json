Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that scientific studies or authoritative bodies do not support the claim that breastfeeding significantly increases a child's intelligence. The first argument cites a specific study (PROBIT) showing no IQ differences, while the second references the American Academy of Pediatrics' stance, which aligns with the lack of evidence for intelligence gains. Both justifications converge on the absence of strong scientific evidence for the claim.
