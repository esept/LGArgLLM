Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument cites data or studies (WHO, OECD, public health studies, national health surveys, dietary patterns) that consistently highlight Mexico's higher obesity rates compared to Ireland, reinforcing the claim. The common theme across all justifications is the comparison of obesity rates or related factors between Mexico and Ireland, supporting the claim that Mexico has a bigger problem with obesity.
