Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not overlap semantically. Each argument addresses a distinct aspect of the claim (non-aligned status, former British colony, presence of an airport, and large Roman Catholic population) without sharing common ideas or reasoning patterns. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
