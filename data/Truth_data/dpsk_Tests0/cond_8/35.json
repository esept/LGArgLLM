Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the rarity or minimal nature of book bans in England, whether through the absence of a formal system, the prioritization of freedom of expression, the repeal of historical bans, the restriction to specific categories like hate speech, or the comparison to other countries. These ideas collectively support the claim that very few books are banned by law in England.
