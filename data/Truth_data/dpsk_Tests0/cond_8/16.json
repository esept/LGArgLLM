Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument provides data or reasoning that supports the idea that smoking rates are higher in the U.S. than in Spain, whether through prevalence rates, consumption data, policy differences, cultural shifts, or statistical comparisons. The common theme across all justifications is the comparative smoking behavior between the two countries, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
