Result: false
Justification: The arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. All three arguments discuss climate factors (maritime vs. continental climate, Gulf Stream influence, and precipitation patterns) that contribute to London's winters being cooler than New York's. However, the justifications do not explicitly share the same propositions or reasoning patterns. For example, the first argument focuses on climate types, the second on oceanic influences, and the third on precipitation differences. While they all support the claim, their justifications do not intersect semantically in a way that every pair shares at least one common idea or proposition.
