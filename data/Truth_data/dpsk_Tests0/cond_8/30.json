Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that travelers need to exchange dollars for the local currencies (euros in France and krone in Denmark) because these are the only legal tenders in their respective countries. The justifications consistently reinforce the necessity of currency exchange due to the non-acceptance of US dollars in France and Denmark. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
