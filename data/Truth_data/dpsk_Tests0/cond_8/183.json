Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the U.S. tax system's progressive nature (with marginal tax rates) ensures that higher income leads to higher take-home pay, even when moving to a higher tax bracket. Each justification reinforces this core concept, either by explaining marginal tax rates, the progressive tax system, or the impact on net income. Thus, all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications.
