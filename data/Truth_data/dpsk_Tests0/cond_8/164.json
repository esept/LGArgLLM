Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument reinforces the idea that wardrobes are ordinary objects without any mechanisms or properties that could cause unusual phenomena, supported by scientific consensus, empirical evidence, and the laws of physics. The common themes include the mundane nature of wardrobes, the absence of documented extraordinary effects, and the reliability of human perception in detecting such effects.
