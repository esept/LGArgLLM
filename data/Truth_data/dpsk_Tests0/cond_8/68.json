Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the lack of scientific evidence or biological plausibility for curing diseases through touch alone, often referencing the need for medical interventions, the nature of diseases, or the absence of empirical validation. For example, arguments about the lack of evidence (A1, A3, A6), the biological basis of diseases (A2, A5), and the placebo effect (A4) all intersect in their reasoning that touch alone cannot cure diseases.
