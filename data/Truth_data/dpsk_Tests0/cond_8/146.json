Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the lack of scientific evidence or recognition supports the claim that no cryptid has been proven real. Each argument reinforces this idea through different angles (e.g., definition of cryptids, scientific consensus, peer-reviewed literature, physical evidence, institutional rejection, and cryptozoology's legitimacy), ensuring overlap in their reasoning.
