Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the distinction between short-term weather (like a cold day) and long-term climate trends (global warming), and they all reinforce the idea that local weather conditions are not indicative of global climate patterns. The common themes include the separation of weather and climate, the need for long-term data, and the possibility of weather variability independent of climate trends.
