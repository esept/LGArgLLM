Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either cites statistical data (USDA, international organizations), cultural factors (cuisine, dietary preferences), or economic factors (cattle industry) that collectively support the claim about Argentina's higher per capita beef consumption compared to the U.S. For example, the mention of statistical data overlaps in multiple arguments, and cultural/economic factors are also recurring themes.
