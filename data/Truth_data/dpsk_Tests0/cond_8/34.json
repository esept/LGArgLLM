Justification: All arguments share the common idea of scientifically validated diets promoting weight loss through various mechanisms, which directly supports the claim that multiple diets (not just carb-cutting) are effective for weight loss. Each argument provides a distinct example (e.g., Mediterranean, DASH, intermittent fasting) but overlaps in the core reasoning: empirical evidence for weight loss via diverse dietary approaches.
