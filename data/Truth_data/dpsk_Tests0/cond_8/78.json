Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument revolves around the idea that the Netherlands has strict laws against the distribution of extreme violence, graphic content, or media that exploits real violence, which directly applies to Faces of Death. The justifications consistently reference Dutch legal prohibitions, public decency laws, and the absence of legal exceptions, ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
