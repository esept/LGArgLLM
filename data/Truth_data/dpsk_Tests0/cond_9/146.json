Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core centered around the lack of scientific evidence or validation for cryptids, which directly supports the claim that no cryptid has been proven to be completely real. Each argument reinforces this core idea by highlighting different aspects of the absence of scientific substantiation (e.g., lack of reproducible evidence, peer-reviewed documentation, physical specimens, or institutional recognition).
