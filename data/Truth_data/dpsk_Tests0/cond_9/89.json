Result: true  
Justification: All justifications support the claim by providing evidence that Paul Dirac was a physicist born in Britain who won the Nobel Prize for Physics. The first justification confirms his Nobel Prize win, the second confirms his birthplace in Britain, and the third reinforces the significance of his work qualifying for the Nobel Prize. Together, they form a coherent and consistent support for the claim.
