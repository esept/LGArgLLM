Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim about the United States being a country of immigrants in relation to chicken and pork consumption. While the arguments explain why chicken is more consumed than pork in the U.S., they do not collectively address the immigrant aspect of the claim. Therefore, there is no shared semantic intersection that fully supports the claim as stated.
