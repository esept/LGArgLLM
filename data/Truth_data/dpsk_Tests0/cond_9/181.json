Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to legal restrictions on recording children in the UK, citing various laws (Data Protection Act 2018, GDPR, Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, Human Rights Act 1998, Investigatory Powers Act 2016) and principles (data protection, privacy, safeguarding).
