Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that the human body has inherent detoxification systems (e.g., liver and kidneys) that function optimally without juice fasts, and there is no scientific or medical basis to support the idea that juice fasts enhance or replace these natural processes. The justifications collectively reinforce this shared basis for the claim.
