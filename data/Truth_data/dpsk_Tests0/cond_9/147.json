Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core of demonstrating decreased food affordability in America through various economic indicators (inflation-adjusted food prices, income growth vs. food price inflation, food insecurity rates, production costs, disposable income spent on food, and comparative OECD data). Each justification supports the claim by showing different facets of the same underlying trend of reduced affordability.
