Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided focus on different aspects of beer consumption in the U.S. (market research and the craft beer movement) but do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim that Americans drink more beer than Europeans. The first justification mentions higher total sales volume in the U.S., while the second discusses the impact of the craft beer movement on domestic consumption. These are related but not overlapping in a way that forms a shared semantic basis for the claim.
