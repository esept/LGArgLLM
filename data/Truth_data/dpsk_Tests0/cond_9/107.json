Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core supporting the claim that the Roswell incident involved a balloon. They reference Project Mogul, eyewitness accounts matching balloon materials, lack of contradictory evidence, initial misidentification corrected to a weather balloon, and declassified government reports confirming military projects. This consistent focus on balloon-related explanations forms a shared basis for the claim.
