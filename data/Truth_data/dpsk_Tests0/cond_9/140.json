Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Each justification addresses a different aspect of the claim (distinctive looks, decades of fame, marriages and children, online presence, political views) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, there is no single semantic intersection that supports all parts of the claim.
