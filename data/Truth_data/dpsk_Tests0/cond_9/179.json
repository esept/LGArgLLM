Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by emphasizing the safety of nuclear power relative to other energy sources. They highlight lower mortality rates, rare severe accidents, minimal pollution, stringent safety standards, and consistent rankings by scientific bodies as evidence of nuclear power's safety. This collective focus on comparative safety and scientific consensus aligns with the claim.
