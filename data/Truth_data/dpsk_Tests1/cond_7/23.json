Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument discusses historical concealment of UFO sightings for national security reasons, while another addresses the implausibility of a global conspiracy. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
