Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument discusses cultural factors (active lifestyle, sports) in Ireland that mitigate obesity, while the second argument focuses on the trend of rising obesity rates in Ireland compared to Mexico. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
