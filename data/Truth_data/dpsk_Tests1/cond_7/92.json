Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on behavior, competence, and attire as determinants of professionalism, the second on cultural and industry norms, and the third on gender stereotypes. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
