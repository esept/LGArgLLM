Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first argument ("Thousands of scientists...") and the second argument ("Independent verification...") both address the credibility and verification of the moon landings, overlapping in their support of the claim. Similarly, the third argument ("Moon rocks...") and the fourth argument ("The 'anomalies'...") both provide evidence against the conspiracy theory, further overlapping in their semantic content. Thus, there are multiple pairs of arguments whose justifications share common semantic subsets supporting the claim.
