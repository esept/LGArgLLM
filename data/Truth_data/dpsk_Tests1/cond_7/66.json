Result: true
Justification: The two arguments provided have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on smoking rates as a contributing factor to bad breath, while the second argument discusses the impact of French diets (strong cheeses and wines) on bad breath. These are distinct and unrelated reasons, so their justifications do not share a common semantic subset.
