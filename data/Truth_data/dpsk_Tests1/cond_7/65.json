Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on artists who claim their ideas come purely from imagination, while the second argument discusses abstract art lacking traceable sources. These points do not overlap in meaning and address different aspects of the claim.
