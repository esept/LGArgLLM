Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the lack of scientific evidence, the second on the biological regulation of sleep, and the third on the metaphorical nature of historical accounts. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
