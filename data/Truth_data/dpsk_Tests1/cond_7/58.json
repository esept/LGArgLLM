Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument compares median household income between the U.S. and specific European countries, the second focuses on take-home pay due to lower taxes compared to high-income countries, and the third discusses sector-specific salaries in the U.S. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
