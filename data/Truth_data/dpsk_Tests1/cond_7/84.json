Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument compares Schindler's List to The Shawshank Redemption based on their rankings on AFI's list, while the second argument questions the subjectivity and relevance of AFI's list in reflecting contemporary critical consensus. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
