Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites folklore and literature (W.W. Jacobs' story), the second refers to cultural traditions of talismans, and the third discusses the cursed nature of the paw. While all support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping lines of reasoning.
