Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all address different restrictions or conditions that limit the claim that "anyone can carry a gun legally" in the US, such as prohibitions for felons, mental health conditions, minors, strict state laws, and background check requirements. However, they all contribute to the same overarching point that the claim is overly broad and incorrect due to various legal restrictions.
