Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Hauptmann's conviction and execution, the second on the possession of ransom money, and the third on the lack of evidence for alternative theories. While all support the claim, they do not share a common semantic subset in their justifications.
