Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., context of the statement, historical allegations, lack of evidence, public interpretation) that does not overlap with the others in supporting the claim that Nixon was referring to his personal finances. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
