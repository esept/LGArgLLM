Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to comparative height data between Americans and the Dutch, while the third and fourth arguments both discuss factors like nutrition and population diversity affecting average height. These overlaps indicate shared semantic subsets contributing to the support of the claim.
