Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument discusses confounding factors (healthier lifestyles), the second focuses on the limitations of observational studies (causation), and the third addresses potential harms (cancer risk vs. cardiovascular benefits). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
