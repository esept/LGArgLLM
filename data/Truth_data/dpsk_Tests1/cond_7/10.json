Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why science does not say dreams can reveal something about us: lack of empirical evidence, random neural activity, speculative interpretations, and influence of daily experiences. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
