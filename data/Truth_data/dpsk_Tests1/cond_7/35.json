Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. All three arguments mention aspects of England's legal or societal framework (history of free speech, Human Rights Act, modern societal opposition to censorship) that contribute to the rarity of book bans. Since none of the pairs are semantically disjoint, the result is false.
