Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (historical records, diverse environments, theatrical origins, ninja manuals, practicality of colors, and historical accounts) that does not overlap in meaning with the others, even though they all support the claim in different ways.
