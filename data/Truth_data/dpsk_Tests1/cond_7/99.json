Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why lie detector tests are not accurate (e.g., being fooled by trained individuals, false positives due to stress, lack of empirical validation, inability to distinguish stress sources). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
