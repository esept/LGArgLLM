Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification discusses the context-dependency of priming effects, while the second focuses on the broader impact of Bargh's study on the discussion of unconscious priming. There is no overlap in their semantic contributions to the claim.
