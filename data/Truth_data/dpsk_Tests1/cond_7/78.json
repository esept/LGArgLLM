Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument states that Faces of Death remains banned despite other films being re-evaluated, while the second argument suggests that the relaxation of censorship laws could imply the film is no longer outlawed. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
