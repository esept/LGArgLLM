Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to West Virginia's high obesity rates and its comparison to other states. For example, the first and second arguments both reference West Virginia's top ranking in obesity, while the third and fourth arguments discuss how other states (Mississippi, Louisiana) compare to West Virginia. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
