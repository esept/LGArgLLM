Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint, as they all relate to the origin of fortune cookies in California rather than China. However, they each provide distinct pieces of evidence or reasoning (e.g., historical records, design and ingredients, lack of documentation in China, business owner claims, marketing influence, Japanese inspiration, cultural association). Since they do not share identical semantic subsets, at least one pair is disjoint.
