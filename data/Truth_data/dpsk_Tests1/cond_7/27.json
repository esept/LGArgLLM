Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the prevalence and mortality of skin cancer, the second on behavioral factors increasing risk for women, and the third on statistical data from a specific source. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
