Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic subset. The first argument states the absence of federal laws protecting praying mantises, the second mentions that they are not listed as endangered or protected under specific acts, and the third notes that local ordinances might protect some insects but generally not praying mantises. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
