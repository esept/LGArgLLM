Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the visual evidence in the portrait (hand position near the belt), while the second argument relies on historical records (Henry VIII often carried a dagger). These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
