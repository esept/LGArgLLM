Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content regarding smoking rates in the U.S. and Spain. For example, the first and fourth arguments both discuss the prevalence or rates of smoking in the two countries, even though they reach different conclusions. This overlap means the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
