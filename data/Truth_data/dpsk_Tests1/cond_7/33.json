Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to porcupines using their tails defensively, with overlapping details about quills, tail-swiping motions, and muscular adaptations. Thus, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
