Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., London's status as a most visited city, Heathrow Airport's traffic, global air connectivity, and major events/business hubs) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning.
