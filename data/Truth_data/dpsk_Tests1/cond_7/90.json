Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the intensity of snowstorms due to proximity to weather systems, while the second argument discusses temperature differences affecting snow retention. These points do not overlap in their support for the claim about snowfall comparison.
