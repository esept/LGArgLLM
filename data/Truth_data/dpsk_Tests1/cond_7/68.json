Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument presents a distinct reason (lack of medical evidence, placebo effect, lack of scientific validation, and absence in modern healthcare) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
