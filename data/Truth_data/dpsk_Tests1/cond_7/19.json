Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or evidence (e.g., Gini coefficient, tax system, wealth concentration, middle class size, regional inequality, poverty rates, informal economy, historical trends, minimum wage) to support the claim that US incomes are less unequal than those in Brazil. None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
