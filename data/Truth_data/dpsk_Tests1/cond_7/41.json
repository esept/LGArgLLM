Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on students valuing in-person interaction and real-time Q&A, while the second argument discusses the impact of mandatory or graded attendance. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
