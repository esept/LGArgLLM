Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the catastrophic consequences of nuclear meltdowns, the second on the unresolved issue of nuclear waste disposal, and the third on the security risks from terrorism or military attacks. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the safety concerns related to nuclear power, with no overlap in their semantic content contributing to the support of the claim.
