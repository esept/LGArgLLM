Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the historical events and the symbolism of resistance against foreign powers, while the second argument emphasizes the celebratory practices and their role in reinforcing national identity. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
