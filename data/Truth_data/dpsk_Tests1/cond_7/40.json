Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Each argument presents a distinct reason why the claim is baseless (e.g., lack of scientific evidence, intelligence determined by cognitive abilities, personal choice unrelated to intelligence, and biases unrelated to actual intelligence). Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
