Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the incorrect assumption that Turkey is part of the EU, while the second argument discusses Turkey's cultural and religious identity compared to other EU countries. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
