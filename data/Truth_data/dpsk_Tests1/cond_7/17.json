Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or piece of evidence (e.g., Acts of Union, legal systems, devolved parliament, national symbols, historical documents) to support the claim that Scotland is not part of England but a distinct entity within the UK. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
