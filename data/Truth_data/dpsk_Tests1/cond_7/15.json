Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or evidence (e.g., lack of scientific evidence, misuse of terminology, trained techniques vs. innate ability, lack of widespread documentation, anecdotal reports being unreliable, neuroscience findings) that independently undermines the claim without overlapping in meaning.
