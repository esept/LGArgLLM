Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Francis Hopkinson's claim and its disputed nature, while the second argument discusses the Betsy Ross narrative's popularity despite lack of contemporaneous evidence. These justifications address different historical claims and evidence, with no overlap in their semantic content contributing to the claim.
