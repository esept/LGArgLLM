Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to different aspects of poverty in Africa, such as the number of people in extreme poverty, rankings by international organizations, regional poverty rates, comparisons with other continents, and contributing factors. While they all support the claim, their justifications do not share a common semantic subset, making them semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
