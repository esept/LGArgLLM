Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the necessity of swimming for breathing, the second on the lack of an alternative breathing mechanism, and the third on the disruption of hunting and survival strategies. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of why stopping swimming would have consequences for tiger sharks, with no overlap in meaning.
