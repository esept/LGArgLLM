Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the shared biological classification (order Anura), while the second argument emphasizes the superficial nature of the distinctions between toads and frogs. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
