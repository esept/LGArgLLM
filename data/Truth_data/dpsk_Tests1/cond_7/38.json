Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a different aspect of the claim (e.g., historical annexation, sovereignty, cultural autonomy, language, and religion) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
