Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a different type of weapon (guns, pepper spray, knives, clubs) and provides distinct legal reasoning for why carrying them is restricted or prohibited in Canada. There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
