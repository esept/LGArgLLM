Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification discusses the impact of ambient temperature on perceived chilliness, while the second focuses on individual differences in metabolism and clothing. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
