Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the overstatement of the percentage due to secularization and nominal Christianity, while the second argument highlights the growing non-religious population in New York City as a factor reducing the Christian percentage. These justifications address different aspects (secularization vs. non-religious growth) and do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
