Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites Statistics Canada's 2021 census data, the second refers to the Canadian Community Health Survey, and the third compares Canada's data to peer nations like the UK. Each justification relies on a distinct source or method of support, with no overlap in semantic content.
