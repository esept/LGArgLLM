Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not disjoint as they all address the same claim about the number of finger bones in humans. They overlap in discussing the anatomy of fingers and potential misunderstandings, but each provides a distinct perspective or correction to the claim. For example, one argument addresses the total count of finger bones, another corrects the count per hand, and others discuss potential miscounts or misinterpretations. Thus, there is semantic overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim.
