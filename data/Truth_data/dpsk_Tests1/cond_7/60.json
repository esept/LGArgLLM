Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the idea that parrots' word association does not constitute fluency, while the second justification highlights contextual word use as a rudimentary form of language use. These points do not overlap in meaning when supporting the claim.
