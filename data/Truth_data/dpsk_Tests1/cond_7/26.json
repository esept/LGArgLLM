Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the arguments about scientific studies finding no evidence and major health organizations not recognizing pangolin scales as a treatment both implicitly rely on the lack of empirical evidence. Similarly, the argument about keratin composition and the argument about clinical trials not validating efficacy both indirectly address the lack of medicinal properties. However, since the justifications are not identical and each introduces a distinct aspect (e.g., scientific studies, keratin composition, traditional medicine superstition, health organizations' stance, clinical trials), there is some semantic overlap but not complete disjointness. Thus, the answer is true because not all pairs are fully disjoint.
