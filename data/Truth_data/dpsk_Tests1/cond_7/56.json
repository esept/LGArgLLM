Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the claim that porcupines do not actively shoot or fire their quills. They all discuss how the quills detach upon contact, the barbed nature of the quills, and the misconception that porcupines can fire their quills. Since none of the justifications are semantically disjoint, the result is false.
