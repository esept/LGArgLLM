Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all provide different but related reasons to refute the claim that the Aztec Empire existed thousands of years ago. For example, one argument cites the establishment date of the Aztec Empire (1428), another mentions the height of the empire in the 15th and 16th centuries, another refers to the Spanish conquest in 1521, another contrasts the Aztec Empire with truly ancient civilizations, and another notes the founding date of Tenochtitlan (1325). While these justifications are all related to the claim, they are semantically disjoint in the sense that each provides a distinct piece of evidence or reasoning to counter the claim without overlapping in meaning.
