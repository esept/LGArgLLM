Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all address the misconception that 'AD' means 'After Death' by providing different historical, linguistic, and logical reasons. While they all support the same conclusion (that the claim is incorrect), their justifications do not share a common semantic subset; each provides a distinct line of reasoning (e.g., definition of 'Anno Domini', timing of Jesus' death, historical records). Thus, at least one pair of justifications is semantically disjoint.
