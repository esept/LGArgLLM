Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications refer to the historical context of book bans in Ireland and specifically mention the controversial or morally objectionable content of the listed books. The first justification provides direct evidence of the bans, while the second explains the broader legal context, but both contribute to supporting the claim by overlapping in their reference to the reasons for the bans.
