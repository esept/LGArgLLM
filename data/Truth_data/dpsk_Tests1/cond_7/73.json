Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share the common semantic theme that Northern Ireland is distinct from England in terms of political, geographical, historical, and cultural aspects, despite both being part of the UK. For example, arguments about Northern Ireland's devolved government, geographical location, and distinct cultural identities all contribute to the same overarching point that Northern Ireland is not part of England.
