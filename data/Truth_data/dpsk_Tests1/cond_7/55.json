Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each address different aspects of the claim (location, rankings, law school presence, architectural description) without overlapping in their reasoning. For example, one argument focuses on Princeton's location in the U.S., another on the absence of a law school, and another on rankings, all of which independently disprove the claim.
