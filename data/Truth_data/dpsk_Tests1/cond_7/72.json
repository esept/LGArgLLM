Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the claim, which is the comparison of winter temperatures between London and New York. Each argument provides different facets of this comparison (e.g., influence of Gulf Stream, extreme cold snaps, average temperatures, proximity to Atlantic Ocean, minimum temperatures), but none are disjoint as they all contribute to the same overarching point about London's winters being cooler than New York's.
