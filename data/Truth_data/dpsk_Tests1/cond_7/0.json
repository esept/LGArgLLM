Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on French being the official language of France, the second on French being an official language of the EU, and the third on French being learned as a second language. While all relate to the prominence of French in Europe, they address distinct aspects (national language, EU language, and second language learning) without overlapping in meaning.
