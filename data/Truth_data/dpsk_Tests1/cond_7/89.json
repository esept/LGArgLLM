Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument justifies the claim by stating Dirac's Nobel Prize win and its reason, the second by confirming his British nationality, and the third by confirming his Jewish descent. None of these justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
