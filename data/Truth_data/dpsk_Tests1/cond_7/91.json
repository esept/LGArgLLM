Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why the claim is unlikely to be true: the first focuses on the cultural and national identity of Ulstermen, the second on the lack of documented evidence, and the third on the inconsistency of the possessive phrasing. None of these justifications overlap in meaning.
