Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., legal protections, lack of centralized system, comparison to other countries, and rarity of national bans). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
