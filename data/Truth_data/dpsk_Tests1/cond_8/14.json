Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications. The first argument focuses on how coughing increases intrathoracic pressure to maintain blood flow, while the second argument emphasizes that coughing is not a reliable substitute for CPR and only works in rare cases. There is no semantic overlap in their justifications regarding the claim.
