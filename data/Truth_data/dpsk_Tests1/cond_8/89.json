Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on Dirac's Nobel Prize and his contributions to quantum mechanics, the second on his birthplace and British nationality, and the third on his Jewish descent. There is no common idea or proposition shared across all pairs of justifications that directly supports the claim.
