Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the distinct status of Scotland within the UK. For example, the Acts of Union (A1), separate legal and education systems (A2), devolved parliament (A3), the term 'United Kingdom' (A4), national symbols (A5), and historical documents (A6) all reinforce the idea that Scotland is a distinct entity and not part of England. Each argument contributes to this overarching theme, ensuring overlap in their justifications.
