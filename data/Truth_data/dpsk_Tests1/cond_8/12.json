Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the comparative winter temperatures of Paris and Philadelphia, focusing on factors such as climate type (maritime vs. continental), historical weather data, frequency of snowfall and sub-freezing temperatures, and the urban heat island effect. These elements collectively support the claim that Paris's winter temperature is cooler than Philadelphia's.
