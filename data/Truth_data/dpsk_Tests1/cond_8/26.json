Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either references the lack of scientific evidence, the composition of pangolin scales, the absence of recognition by health organizations, or the lack of clinical validation. These themes are interconnected and support the claim that pangolin scales are not an effective medicine.
