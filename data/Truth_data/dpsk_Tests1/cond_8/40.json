Result: false
Justification: While all arguments oppose the claim by stating that hair length is unrelated to intelligence, the justifications do not overlap semantically in a way that supports the claim. Each argument presents a distinct reason (lack of scientific evidence, cognitive abilities, personal choice, and biases) without shared propositions or reasoning patterns that directly support the claim. Therefore, not all pairs share semantic intersections in their justifications.
