Result: false
Justification: While all arguments oppose the claim by stating that Northern Ireland is not part of England, their justifications do not all share overlapping semantic content. For example, the argument about the Northern Ireland Assembly does not semantically overlap with the argument about geographical separation, as they address different aspects (political governance vs. physical location). Similarly, the argument about cultural identities does not directly overlap with the argument about the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Thus, not all pairs of arguments share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
