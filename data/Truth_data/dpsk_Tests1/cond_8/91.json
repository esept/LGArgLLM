Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. Each argument presents a distinct reason why Ulstermen would not refer to New York City in the given manner: the first focuses on cultural identity, the second on lack of evidence, and the third on the inconsistency of the phrase with Ulster's relationship to New York City. There is no semantic overlap between these justifications.
