Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that King Henry VIII is associated with carrying a dagger, which supports the claim that he is reaching for one in the portrait. The first argument focuses on the visual evidence (hand position near the belt), while the second provides historical context (Henry VIII often carried a dagger). Together, they reinforce the claim through overlapping semantic justifications.
