Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the price disparity between base models and premium electronics, while the second argument discusses hidden costs and long-term affordability issues. These are distinct points without a common idea or reasoning pattern.
