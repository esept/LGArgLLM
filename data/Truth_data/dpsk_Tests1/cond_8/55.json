Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. Instead, they each provide distinct reasons why the claim is incorrect, such as Princeton's location, ranking context, and lack of a law school. There is no semantic overlap in their justifications that supports the claim.
