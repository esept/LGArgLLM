Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share any overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument compares Schindler's List to The Shawshank Redemption in terms of their rankings on AFI's list, while the second argument questions the subjectivity and relevance of AFI's list itself. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
