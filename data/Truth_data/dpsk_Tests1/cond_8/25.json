Result: false
Justification: The arguments share overlapping semantic justifications with the claim but not necessarily with each other. For example, the argument about New York City being a global economic hub does not directly overlap in justification with the argument about its high cost of living. While all arguments support the claim, they do not all share common justifications with each other.
