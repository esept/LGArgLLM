Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in relation to the claim. For example, the first argument discusses the 'fair dealing' exception, while the second argument focuses on the lack of explicit exemption based on profit motive. These justifications address different aspects of copyright law and do not overlap semantically in supporting the claim.
