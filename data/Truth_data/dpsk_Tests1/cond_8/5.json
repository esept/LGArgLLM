Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The common theme is that London's attributes (e.g., being a highly visited city, having a busy airport, strong air connectivity, and hosting global events) collectively support the idea that it receives more international arrivals than Paris. Each argument reinforces this claim by highlighting different but interconnected aspects of London's appeal and infrastructure.
