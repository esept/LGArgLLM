Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses aspects of ninja clothing in terms of practicality, historical accuracy, or the need for blending in, whether through social camouflage (e.g., disguises as farmers/merchants), environmental adaptability (e.g., forests/villages), or debunking the all-black stereotype (e.g., kabuki origins or unnatural silhouettes). The common theme across all justifications is that ninjas prioritized functional, situation-appropriate attire over the popularized all-black depiction.
