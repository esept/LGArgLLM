Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first and second arguments both reference cultural or literary traditions that support the idea of the monkey's paw granting wishes. The first and third arguments both mention the monkey's paw's function in granting wishes, albeit with different emphases (explicit function vs. cursed function). The second and third arguments both touch on the supernatural or power aspect of the monkey's paw, linking it to wish-granting capabilities.
