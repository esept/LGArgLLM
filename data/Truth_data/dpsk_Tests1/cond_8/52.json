Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the catastrophic consequences of nuclear meltdowns, the second on the unresolved issue of nuclear waste disposal, and the third on the security risks from terrorism or military attacks. These are distinct concerns without semantic overlap.
