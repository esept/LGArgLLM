Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern. The first argument states that tiger sharks must keep swimming to breathe, the second that they lack the ability to switch to buccal pumping, and the third that ceasing movement would disrupt their hunting. While all relate to the consequences of stopping swimming, they address different aspects (breathing, adaptation, hunting) without overlapping semantic content.
