Result: false
Justification: While all arguments oppose the claim, their justifications do not all share a common idea or reasoning pattern. For example, the first argument focuses on historical concealment for national security, while the second argues about the implausibility of a global conspiracy. These justifications do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
