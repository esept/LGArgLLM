Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that parrots' word association falls short of fluency, while the second argument suggests that some birds demonstrate rudimentary language use. These justifications address different aspects of language ability in birds without a common idea or reasoning pattern.
