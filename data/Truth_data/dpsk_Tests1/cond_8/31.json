Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on Hauptmann's conviction and execution, the second on the possession of ransom money, and the third on the lack of evidence for alternative theories. While all support the claim, their justifications do not overlap semantically.
