Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that Faces of Death remains absent from legal distribution despite re-evaluation of other banned films, while the second argument suggests that the relaxation of censorship laws could imply Faces of Death is no longer explicitly outlawed. These justifications present opposing perspectives without a common idea or reasoning pattern.
