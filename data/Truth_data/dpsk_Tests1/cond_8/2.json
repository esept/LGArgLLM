Result: false
Justification: While all arguments oppose the claim by pointing out that the Aztec Empire existed much more recently than "thousands of years ago," they do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, one argument focuses on the establishment date (1428), another on the conquest date (1521), and another on the founding of Tenochtitlan (1325). These are distinct pieces of evidence, not overlapping justifications.
