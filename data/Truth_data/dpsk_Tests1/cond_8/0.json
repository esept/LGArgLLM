Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not fully overlap semantically in relation to the claim. While all arguments support the claim that "All Europeans speak French," they do so based on different reasoning patterns: the first focuses on France as a major European country, the second on the European Union's official languages, and the third on French as a commonly learned second language. There is no single common idea or proposition shared by all pairs of justifications that directly supports the claim.
