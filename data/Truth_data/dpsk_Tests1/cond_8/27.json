Result: false
Justification: The first and second arguments share a common idea about skin cancer being a significant threat to women due to its prevalence and high mortality rates (melanoma) and behaviors increasing risk (tanning). However, the third argument introduces a contrasting point by stating that skin cancer does not necessarily cause the highest number of deaths among women, which contradicts the claim and does not overlap semantically with the other arguments in supporting the claim. Thus, not all pairs share semantic intersections in their justifications.
