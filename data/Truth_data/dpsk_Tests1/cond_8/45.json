Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on different aspects of poverty in Africa (e.g., number of people in extreme poverty, rankings by international organizations, regional poverty rates, comparison with other continents, and contributing factors), but all ultimately support the claim that Africa is the continent with the most poverty. The common theme across all justifications is the prevalence and severity of poverty in Africa compared to other continents.
