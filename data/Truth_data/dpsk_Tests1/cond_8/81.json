Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument refutes the claim by pointing out that 'AD' stands for 'Anno Domini' and not 'After Death', and they all reference historical, linguistic, or calendar-based evidence to support this. The common idea across all justifications is the correction of the misconception about the meaning of 'AD'.
