Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on smoking rates as a cause of bad breath, while the second argument focuses on dietary factors like cheeses and wines. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
