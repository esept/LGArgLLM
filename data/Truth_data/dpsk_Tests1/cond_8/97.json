Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern. The first argument provides a modern estimate of neuron count, the second explains why the claim might have been made historically, and the third discusses the implications of the claim on computational capacity. There is no semantic overlap between these justifications in relation to the claim.
