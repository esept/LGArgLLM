Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the lack of scientific evidence or practical adoption of touch as a cure for diseases, whether through the absence of documented evidence (A1), the limitations of the placebo effect (A2), the lack of rigorous validation for historical claims (A3), or the absence of touch-based treatments in modern healthcare (A4). These justifications collectively reinforce the claim by addressing different facets of the same core idea: the implausibility of touch curing diseases.
