Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. Each argument presents a distinct reason why lie detector tests are unreliable (e.g., being fooled by trained individuals, false positives due to stress, lack of empirical validation, inability to distinguish stress sources). There is no semantic overlap in their justifications.
