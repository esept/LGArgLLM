Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the incorrect assumption that Turkey is part of the EU, while the second argument discusses Turkey's cultural and religious identity being distinct from most EU countries. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
