Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on Francis Hopkinson's claim and its disputed nature, while the second argument discusses the Betsy Ross narrative and its lack of contemporaneous evidence. These are distinct lines of reasoning without a common idea or proposition supporting the claim.
