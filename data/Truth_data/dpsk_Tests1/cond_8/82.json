Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument presents a distinct critique of Baumeister's ego depletion experiments (mixed replicability, lack of controls, and participant expectations as an artifact), but they do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
