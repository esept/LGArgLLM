Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the mechanism of quill detachment (e.g., quills detach upon contact, barbed quills, physical contact required) and refutes the idea of projectile ejection. The common themes include the biological impossibility of firing quills, the role of physical contact, and the origin of the myth. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects semantically on these core ideas.
