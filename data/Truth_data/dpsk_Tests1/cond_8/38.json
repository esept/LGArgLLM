Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not all share a common semantic intersection. While some arguments overlap in discussing Iceland's independence (e.g., sovereignty from Denmark, lack of annexation), others focus on unrelated aspects like language or religion. For example, the argument about English being widely spoken does not semantically intersect with the argument about Iceland's political autonomy.
