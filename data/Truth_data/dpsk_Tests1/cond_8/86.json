Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the lack of scientific evidence, the second on the biological regulation of sleep, and the third on historical accounts being metaphorical. These are distinct points without semantic overlap.
