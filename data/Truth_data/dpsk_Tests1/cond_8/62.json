Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument suggests that premature expectations can lead to failure, while the second argues that premature expectations (counting chickens before they hatch) can actually enhance performance through positive visualization. These justifications present opposing ideas rather than overlapping ones.
