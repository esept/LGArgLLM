Result: false
Justification: While all arguments oppose the claim by questioning the existence or prevalence of truly photographic memory, their justifications do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the argument about the misuse of the term 'photographic memory' does not overlap semantically with the argument about neuroscience research on memory function. Similarly, the argument about trained memory techniques does not share a semantic intersection with the argument about the lack of widespread documentation. Thus, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
