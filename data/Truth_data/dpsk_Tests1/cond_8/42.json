Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim that Nixon was referring to his personal finances. Instead, they all argue against the claim by focusing on the context of the Watergate scandal and the interpretation of the phrase 'I am not a crook' as related to political misconduct, not personal finances. There is no overlap in justifications that supports the claim.
