Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first argument points to the visual evidence in the portrait (hand position near the belt), while the second provides historical context (Henry VIII often carried a dagger). Together, they form a coherent basis for the claim that Henry is reaching for a dagger in the portrait.
