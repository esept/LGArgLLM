Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification states that outdoor access may be limited or seasonal, while the second argues that "cage-free" does not legally guarantee outdoor access. Both justifications undermine the claim rather than support it, and they do not intersect in a way that provides a shared basis for the claim.
