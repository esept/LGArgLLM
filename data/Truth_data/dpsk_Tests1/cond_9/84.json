Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification compares Schindler's List to another film (The Shawshank Redemption) in terms of ranking, while the second justification questions the subjectivity and potential outdatedness of AFI's list. These points do not intersect semantically to support the claim.
