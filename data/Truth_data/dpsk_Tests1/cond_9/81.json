Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. While all arguments refute the claim, they do so using different reasoning: one focuses on the correct definition ('Anno Domini'), another on the timing of Jesus' birth vs. death, another on the misconception itself, and the last on the inconsistency in calendar numbering. There is no single semantic intersection across all justifications.
