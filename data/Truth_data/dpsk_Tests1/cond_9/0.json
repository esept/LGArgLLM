Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not collectively support the claim that "All Europeans speak French." While they highlight the prominence and importance of French in Europe, they do not establish that every European speaks French. The arguments focus on French being an official language in some contexts and widely learned, but this does not equate to universal fluency among all Europeans.
