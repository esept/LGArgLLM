Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first justification mentions increasing intrathoracic pressure to maintain blood flow, while the second justification states that coughing is not a reliable substitute for CPR. These justifications do not intersect in meaning to collectively support the claim.
