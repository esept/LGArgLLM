Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments mention that non-commercial use may reduce penalties or be considered under 'fair dealing,' others explicitly state that lack of profit does not exempt one from infringement claims. There is no consistent intersection that supports the claim that not making money off copyrighted work provides protection against infringement claims in the U.K.
