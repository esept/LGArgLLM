Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument disputes the claim by stating that Turkey is not part of the EU, while the second argument discusses Turkey's cultural and religious identity. There is no intersection in meaning between these justifications that supports the claim.
