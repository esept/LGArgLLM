Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. While they all support the claim that the U.S. consumes more chicken than pork, the reasons provided are diverse (cultural preference, religious restrictions, fast-food industry influence, regional consumption patterns, and health perceptions). There is no single overlapping justification that all arguments rely on.
