Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not fully overlap in their semantic content. The first argument mentions that all three countries are part of the Eurozone, while the second argument focuses on the adoption dates of the euro in France and Germany but does not mention Switzerland. Therefore, there is no common semantic core that includes all three countries.
