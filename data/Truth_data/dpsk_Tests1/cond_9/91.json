Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by pointing out the lack of cultural or national affiliation between Ulstermen and New York City, and the absence of evidence for such a reference. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim; rather, all justifications oppose it.
