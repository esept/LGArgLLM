Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by emphasizing the Californian origin of fortune cookies, their lack of presence in traditional Chinese cuisine, and the role of Japanese immigrants or Chinese-American businesses in their creation and popularization. Each argument contributes to this shared basis by providing historical, cultural, or culinary evidence that aligns with the claim.
