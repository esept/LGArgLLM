Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification suggests context-dependency as a reason for non-replication, while the second focuses on the study's contribution to broader discussions, neither directly supporting the claim's assertion about failure to establish a psychological law.
