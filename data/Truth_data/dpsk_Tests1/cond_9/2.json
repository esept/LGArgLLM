Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of all P-type arguments consistently refute the claim by providing evidence that the Aztec Empire existed much more recently than "thousands of years ago." However, since the claim is false and the arguments oppose it, there is no shared semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, the justifications collectively undermine the claim by pointing to its inaccuracy.
