Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively refute the claim by asserting Iceland's independence, sovereignty, and cultural autonomy, directly contradicting the claim of annexation by a great continental power. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
