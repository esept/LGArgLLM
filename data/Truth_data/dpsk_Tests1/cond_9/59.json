Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification suggests that the 60% figure might be overstated due to secularization, while the second points to a growing non-religious population in NYC potentially reducing the Christian percentage. Both justifications cast doubt on the claim rather than supporting it with a shared basis.
