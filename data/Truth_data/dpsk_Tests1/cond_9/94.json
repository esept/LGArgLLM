Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they both refute the claim by pointing out that Columbia University is not in Wales and thus cannot be described by the Welsh as one of their most famous universities. There is no overlap in meaning that supports the claim.
