Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that London's winters are milder or cooler than New York's due to factors like the Gulf Stream, proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, and continental climate influences. Each argument supports the claim by highlighting different aspects of this temperature difference, such as milder temperatures, less extreme cold, and higher average temperatures in London compared to New York.
