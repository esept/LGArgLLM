Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by highlighting the lack of scientific evidence, misuse of terminology, reliance on trained techniques, absence of widespread documentation, anecdotal unreliability, and neuroscientific limitations. There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim's validity.
