Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument suggests that Faces of Death remains banned despite other films being re-evaluated, while the second argument implies that the relaxation of censorship laws could mean the film is no longer outlawed. These justifications present conflicting perspectives rather than a shared basis for the claim.
