Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification discusses the diversity of meat consumption in the U.S., while the second focuses on regional differences within the U.S. Neither directly supports the claim about Argentina's higher beef consumption per capita compared to the U.S. as a whole.
