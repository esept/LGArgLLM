Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument focuses on cultural factors (active lifestyle) in Ireland, while the second discusses the rate of change in obesity rates. Neither directly supports the claim about Mexico's higher obesity rate compared to Ireland.
