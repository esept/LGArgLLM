Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments (e.g., the first and third) suggest the U.S. has higher smoking rates, while others (e.g., the second and fourth) imply Spain has higher rates or stricter laws reducing smoking. The justifications contradict each other rather than converging on a shared basis for the claim.
