Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that West Virginia has the highest obesity rates in the U.S., supported by consistent rankings, public health data, socioeconomic factors, and comparisons with other states. This collective evidence uniformly supports the claim that no state is probably significantly more obese than West Virginia.
