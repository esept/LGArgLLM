Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first argument focuses on the prevalence and deadliness of skin cancer, the second on women's behaviors increasing risk, and the third on statistics that do not confirm skin cancer as the leading cause of death among women. There is no intersection in meaning that collectively supports the claim.
