Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that "the moon landings were faked." Instead, they collectively debunk the claim by providing evidence of the landings' authenticity, refuting conspiracy theories, and questioning the generalization about "all truthers." There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
