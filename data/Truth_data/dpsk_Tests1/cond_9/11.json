Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that "Americans are taller on average than the Dutch." Instead, all arguments consistently oppose the claim by providing evidence that the Dutch are taller on average than Americans. There is no intersection of justifications that supports the claim.
