Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on the historical events (Battle of Puebla vs. U.S. independence) and resistance against foreign powers, while the second justification emphasizes the celebratory practices (parades, fireworks) and national identity. These are distinct aspects of the holidays and do not intersect semantically.
