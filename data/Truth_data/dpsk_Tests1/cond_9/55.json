Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively contradict the claim by pointing out factual inaccuracies (e.g., Princeton's location, lack of a law school, and its American identity). Therefore, there is no intersection of justifications that supports the claim.
