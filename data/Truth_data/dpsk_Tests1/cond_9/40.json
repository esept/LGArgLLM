Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by stating that hair length is unrelated to intelligence, intelligence is determined by cognitive abilities and education, and short hair is a personal choice or may lead to biases unrelated to actual intelligence. There is no shared justification supporting the claim that a woman with short hair is more intelligent.
