Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification argues that premature expectations do not always lead to failure, while the second suggests that counting chickens before they hatch can enhance performance. Both justifications oppose the claim but do so on different grounds, so there is no shared semantic intersection.
