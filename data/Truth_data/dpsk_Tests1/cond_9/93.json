Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by stating that carrying guns, knives, clubs, and pepper spray is heavily regulated or prohibited in Canada. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the original claim; rather, the justifications uniformly contradict it.
