Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by comparing income inequality metrics (e.g., Gini coefficient), economic structures (e.g., tax systems, welfare programs), and socio-economic conditions (e.g., middle class stability, regional disparities) between the US and Brazil. Each justification reinforces the idea that the US has less income inequality than Brazil, albeit through different but complementary lenses.
