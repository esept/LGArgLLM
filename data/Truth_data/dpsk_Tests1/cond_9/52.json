Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they highlight different risks (meltdowns, waste disposal, security threats) that collectively oppose the claim about nuclear power being safer. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
