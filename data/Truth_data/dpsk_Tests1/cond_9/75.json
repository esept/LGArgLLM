Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument suggests unpredictability due to external factors, the second argues for potential sustained value due to inflation, and the third points to demand from emerging markets. These justifications address different aspects and do not intersect in a shared semantic basis for the claim.
