Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. While all arguments oppose the claim, they do so based on different reasons (e.g., national security, implausibility of global conspiracy, lack of evidence for alien involvement, absence of alien priorities in policies, and reliance on conspiracy theory frameworks). There is no single overlapping justification that all arguments use to oppose the claim.
