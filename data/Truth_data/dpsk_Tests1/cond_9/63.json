Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument suggests that specially formulated cat milk substitutes are safe and beneficial, while the second argument mentions that veterinarians may recommend electrolyte solutions. Both arguments contradict the claim that cats should only drink water, but they do so based on different reasons (nutrients from milk substitutes vs. medical need for electrolyte solutions). Therefore, there is no shared semantic intersection supporting the claim.
