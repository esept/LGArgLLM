Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. One argument points to smoking rates as a potential cause of bad breath, while the other mentions dietary factors like strong cheeses and wines. These are distinct reasons and do not intersect in meaning to collectively support the claim that French people do not have bad breath.
