Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively challenge the claim by pointing out issues like mixed replicability, lack of proper controls, and potential artifacts in Baumeister's experiments. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim; rather, the arguments undermine it.
