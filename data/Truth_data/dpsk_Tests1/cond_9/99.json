Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a single semantic core. While all arguments highlight reasons why lie detector tests are unreliable, they focus on different aspects (e.g., ability to be fooled, false positives, lack of empirical validation, inability to distinguish stress sources). There is no single overlapping semantic basis across all justifications.
