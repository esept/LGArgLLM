Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument suggests that Montreal sometimes gets more intense snowfall, while the second focuses on Montreal's colder temperatures leading to more consistent snow retention. Neither supports the claim that Barrie gets more snowfall than Montreal; instead, they both provide reasons why Montreal might have significant snowfall.
