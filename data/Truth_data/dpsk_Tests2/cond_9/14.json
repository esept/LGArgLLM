Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on the physiological mechanism (increased intrathoracic pressure maintaining blood flow), while the second argument emphasizes the specific medical context (catheterization lab procedures with professional monitoring). There is no overlapping semantic basis that unites both justifications in support of the claim.
