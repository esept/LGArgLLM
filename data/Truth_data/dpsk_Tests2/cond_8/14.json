Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the physiological mechanism (increased intrathoracic pressure maintaining blood flow), while the second argument discusses the specific medical scenarios where cough CPR is recommended (catheterization lab procedures under professional supervision). These are distinct points without semantic overlap.
