Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument compares income inequality between the US and Brazil using different but related metrics (Gini coefficient, welfare systems, informal economy, and top 1% income share). These metrics all contribute to the broader idea of measuring or explaining income inequality, ensuring semantic overlap between any pair of arguments.
