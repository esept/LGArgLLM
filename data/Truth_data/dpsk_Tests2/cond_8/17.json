Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that Scotland maintains a distinct identity or status within the UK, separate from England. The first argument highlights Scotland's separate legal and education systems, the second emphasizes its devolved parliament, and the third references the Treaty of Union. Despite focusing on different aspects (legal, political, historical), all justifications reinforce the claim that Scotland is not part of England but retains its own identity within the UK.
