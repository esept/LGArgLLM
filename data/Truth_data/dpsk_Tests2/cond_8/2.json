Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dream analysis, climate differences, medical procedures, memory rarity, smoking rates, political unions, income inequality) and do not share any common semantic justifications in relation to the claim about the Aztec Empire. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
