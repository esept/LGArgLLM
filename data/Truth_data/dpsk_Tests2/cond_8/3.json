Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The common ideas include historical/architectural evidence (A1, A3, A4), linguistic origins (A2), and the absence of evidence for vomiting (A3, A4). Each pair intersects on at least one of these themes, supporting the claim that vomitoriums were used as stadium entrances.
