Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss scenarios where tiger sharks do not actively swim but still respire effectively (via ocean currents or artificial water flow). The first and third arguments both imply that tiger sharks can survive without continuous swimming (through evolutionary pressure or natural behaviors). The second and third arguments both suggest that stopping swimming does not cause harm (observed in aquariums or through evolutionary selection). Thus, all pairs intersect on the idea that tiger sharks can stop swimming without negative consequences.
