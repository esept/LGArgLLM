Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the ambiguity in determining the greatest basketball player of all time. The first and second arguments both highlight the difficulty in direct comparisons due to varying metrics (eras/styles vs. statistical achievements). The first and third arguments both emphasize subjective or contextual factors (eras/styles vs. playing style/cultural impact). The second and third arguments both focus on the lack of a single dominant metric (statistical spread vs. subjective preferences). Thus, all pairs overlap in supporting the claim's ambiguity.
