Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on etymological origins, the second on popular culture usage, and the third on the lack of consistent expansion. These are distinct lines of reasoning without semantic overlap.
