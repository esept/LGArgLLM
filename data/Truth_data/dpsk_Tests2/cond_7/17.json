Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim: the first focuses on Scotland's separate legal, education, and religious systems; the second on its distinct political status through its parliament; and the third on the Treaty of Union's specification of Scotland's separate nationhood. None of these justifications overlap in meaning.
