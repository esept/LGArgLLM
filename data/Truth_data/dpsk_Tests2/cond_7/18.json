Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument discusses natural ocean currents providing water flow, the second focuses on artificial environments like aquariums, and the third addresses evolutionary pressures. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
