Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites health statistics on smoking prevalence, the second mentions cultural attitudes, and the third discusses population size and absolute numbers of smokers. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
