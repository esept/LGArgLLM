Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on etymological origins, the second on popular culture usage, and the third on the absence of a consistent expansion. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
