Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the difficulty of comparing players across different eras, the second on statistical achievements spread across multiple players, and the third on subjective factors influencing opinions. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
