Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites anecdotal reports and psychological research, the second focuses on the rarity of documented cases, and the third mentions rare neurological conditions or savant syndromes. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
