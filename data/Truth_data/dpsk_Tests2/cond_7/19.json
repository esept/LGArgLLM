Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both reference the Gini coefficient and Brazil's high income inequality, while the second and third arguments discuss Brazil's informal economy and welfare systems. The fourth argument also overlaps with the first and second by focusing on the income share of the top 1%. Thus, there are multiple pairs of arguments whose justifications share common semantic subsets supporting the claim.
