Result: true
Justification: The first two arguments focus on Henry VIII's portrait and gestures, which are unrelated to the claim about international arrivals in London and Paris. The last two arguments, while related to the claim, are disjoint from the first two in terms of semantic content. Therefore, there exists at least one pair of arguments (e.g., the first and third) whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
