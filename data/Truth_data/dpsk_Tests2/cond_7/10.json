Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the lack of empirical validation and standardized methodologies in dream analysis, the second on neuroscientific research's focus on mechanisms rather than content interpretation, and the third on the speculative nature of psychoanalytic theories. These justifications address different aspects of why science does not support dreams revealing something about us, without overlapping in meaning.
