Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments focus on different aspects of coughing's effectiveness in a heart attack scenario. The first argument discusses the physiological mechanism (increased intrathoracic pressure), while the second argument mentions a specific medical scenario (catheterization lab procedures) where cough CPR is recommended. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
