Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are all unrelated to the claim about the Aztec Empire existing thousands of years ago. Each argument addresses a completely different topic (e.g., dream analysis, climate comparisons, medical procedures, income inequality, etc.), and none of them share any semantic overlap with the claim or with each other in a way that would support or oppose the claim. Therefore, all pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
