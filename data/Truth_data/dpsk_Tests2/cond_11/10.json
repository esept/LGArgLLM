Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on the lack of empirical validation, neuroscientific focus on mechanisms rather than content, speculative nature of psychoanalytic theories, and experimental influence on dream content. None of these justifications semantically contain the support arguments (S-type), which suggest that dreams might reveal aspects of the psyche, show correlations with waking-life stressors, or reflect universal psychological underpinnings. Thus, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments' justifications.
