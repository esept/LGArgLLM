Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that cover the minimal semantic bases for the claim. The first P-type argument addresses the latitude difference, which is a key factor in temperature differences, and the second P-type argument discusses the influence of the Gulf Stream on Paris's climate. The S-type arguments provide additional support by mentioning Philadelphia's continental climate and historical weather data, which are subsets of the broader justifications provided by the P-type arguments. Thus, C11 is satisfied.
