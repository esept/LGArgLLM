Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on London's financial hub status, flight connections, and historical ties, while the S-type arguments highlight Paris's cultural attractions, France's tourism ranking, and cost factors. There is no semantic subset overlap where an S-type argument's justification is contained within a P-type argument's justification to support the claim that London gets more international arrivals than Paris. The S-type arguments actually counter the claim by suggesting reasons why Paris might have more arrivals. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
