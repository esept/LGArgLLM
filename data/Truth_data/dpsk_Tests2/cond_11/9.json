Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide general reasons why the greatest basketball player is not unambiguously determined (e.g., different eras, spread of statistical achievements, subjective factors). However, the S-type arguments present specific cases (Michael Jordan, LeBron James) that could be seen as counterexamples or challenges to the claim, rather than supporting the claim's ambiguity. There is no P-type argument whose justification semantically contains the justifications of the S-type arguments in a way that supports the claim. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
