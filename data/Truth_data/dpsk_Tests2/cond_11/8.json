Result: false  
Justification: The provided P-type arguments focus on factors like aggressive marketing, higher number of legal drinking-age individuals, and social norms in the U.S. However, none of their justifications semantically encompass the minimal support arguments (S-type), which highlight European traditions, higher taxes, alternative drinking habits, and per capita consumption. Thus, C11 is not satisfied because the P-type arguments do not cover all minimal semantic bases of the claim (e.g., European consumption patterns).
