Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications about higher smoking prevalence, cultural attitudes, and population size in the U.S., but none of them explicitly contain the semantic subsets provided by the S-type arguments (stricter anti-smoking laws in Spain and social norms favoring outdoor dining). Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
