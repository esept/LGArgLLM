Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains elements that address different aspects of the claim (practicality, historical origin, cost, and artistic evidence), while the S-type arguments provide fragments that could support subsets of these justifications (e.g., historical mentions of dark garments supporting the practicality argument, or complete darkness effectiveness supporting the artistic evidence argument). Thus, for every minimal semantic basis of the claim, there exists at least one P-type argument whose justification contains that basis.
