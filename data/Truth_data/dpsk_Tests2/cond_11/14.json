Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim by explaining how coughing mimics CPR effects and is recommended in specific scenarios. However, the S-type arguments contradict the claim by stating that coughing is not endorsed as a substitute for CPR, cannot sustain circulation, and is impractical for unconscious victims. There is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of the P-type arguments' justifications and supports the claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
