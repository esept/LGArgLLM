Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications contain the semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, which focus on the lack of causal power or empirical evidence linking dreams to real-world success. The P-type arguments discuss indirect influences (inspiration, cultural beliefs, psychological motivation) but do not address the core S-type points about the absence of a causal mechanism or empirical support. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
