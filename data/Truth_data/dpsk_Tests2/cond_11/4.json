Result: false  
Justification: None of the S-type arguments provide a semantic subset of the P-type arguments' justifications that supports the claim. Instead, the S-type arguments challenge the claim by suggesting alternative interpretations or questioning the alignment with historical artistic conventions. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
