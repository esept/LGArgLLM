Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications fully contain the semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments. The S-type arguments collectively suggest that photographic memory is either extremely rare or a myth, and the P-type arguments do not directly incorporate these strong skeptical or critical perspectives. Instead, the P-type arguments focus on anecdotal reports and plausible rarity without addressing the deeper skepticism or lack of empirical evidence highlighted by the S-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
