Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that suggest tiger sharks can stop swimming without negative consequences due to specific conditions (e.g., ocean currents, artificial water flow, evolutionary pressure). However, the S-type arguments present a minimal semantic basis for the claim by stating that tiger sharks, as obligate ram ventilators, suffocate if they stop swimming unless specific adaptations or conditions are met. None of the P-type arguments' justifications fully contain or address this critical physiological constraint, which is central to the claim. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
