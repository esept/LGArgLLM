Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the prohibition and consequences of lawyers giving false evidence in the U.S. They all refer to legal ethics, professional conduct rules, perjury laws, and disciplinary actions, which collectively support the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
