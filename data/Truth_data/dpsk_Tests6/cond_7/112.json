Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments share a common semantic subset related to the claim. They all discuss how consistently achieving over 15% annual returns for a decade outperforms benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500) and demonstrates superior investment skill, which aligns with the definition of a great investor. Since none of the pairs are semantically disjoint, the result is false.
