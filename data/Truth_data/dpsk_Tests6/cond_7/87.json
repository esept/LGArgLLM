Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning. For example, one argument cites cultural tradition, another mentions production capacity, another discusses dietary habits, and another refers to statistical data. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
