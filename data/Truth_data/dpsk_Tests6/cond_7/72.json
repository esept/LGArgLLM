Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the difference in climate types (temperate maritime vs. humid continental), while the second argument highlights the moderating effect of the Gulf Stream on London's winter temperatures. These are distinct reasons supporting the claim.
