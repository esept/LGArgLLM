Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all support the claim by providing distinct historical and contextual evidence (e.g., Morse code adoption, International Radiotelegraphic Convention records, backronym explanations, and early maritime documents). While they overlap in supporting the claim, their semantic content is disjoint as each provides a unique piece of evidence or reasoning.
