Let's analyze the justifications of the arguments to determine if any pair is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

### Arguments and Justifications:
1. **A1**: By definition, the average (mean) of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers, so at least half the numbers must be less than or equal to the average.
2. **A2**: If the majority of numbers were larger than the average, their excess would require an impossible balancing by the minority being smaller than the average.
3. **A3**: The median, which is the middle value in an ordered set, is always less than or equal to the average in a positively skewed distribution, reinforcing that the majority cannot exceed the average.
4. **A4**: Statistical principles confirm that in any finite set of real numbers, the majority cannot be strictly greater than the arithmetic mean without violating the definition of the mean.

### Pairwise Analysis:
- **A1 and A2**: Both rely on the definition of the mean and the impossibility of a majority exceeding it without contradiction. They are not disjoint.
- **A1 and A3**: A1 uses the definition of the mean, while A3 introduces the median and skewness. These are distinct but related concepts (both support the claim via properties of averages). Not disjoint.
- **A1 and A4**: Both explicitly reference the definition of the mean. Not disjoint.
- **A2 and A3**: A2 discusses balancing excess, while A3 discusses the median and skewness. These are different angles but both support the claim. Not disjoint.
- **A2 and A4**: A2 discusses balancing excess, while A4 reiterates the definition of the mean. Not disjoint.
- **A3 and A4**: A3 introduces the median and skewness, while A4 refers to statistical principles and the mean. These are distinct but not disjoint, as both support the claim via statistical properties.

### Conclusion:
No pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. All justifications overlap or complement each other in supporting the claim.

```
Result: false
Justification: All pairs of justifications share some semantic overlap or complementary support for the claim (e.g., definitions of mean, balancing excess, median/skewness, statistical principles). None are disjoint.
