Result: true
Justification: The two arguments provided have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification discusses epidemiological studies and correlations with cardiovascular diseases, while the second focuses on the biochemical properties of polyphenols like resveratrol. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
