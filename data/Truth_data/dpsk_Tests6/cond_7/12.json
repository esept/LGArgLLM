Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the climate types (temperate oceanic vs. humid subtropical) as the reason for the temperature difference, while the second argument emphasizes geographical location and maritime influence. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
