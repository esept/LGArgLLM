Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., oral hygiene practices, access to dental care, dietary habits, lack of scientific evidence, cultural norms, use of breath-freshening products) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning. No two arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
