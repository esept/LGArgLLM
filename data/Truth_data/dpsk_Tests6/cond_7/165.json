Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., decreased expenditure percentage, technological advancements, global trade, government subsidies, increased real wages, expanded budget-friendly options) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning.
