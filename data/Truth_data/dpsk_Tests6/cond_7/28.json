Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically as they all refer to the euro being the official or sole legal tender in Germany and France, which are part of the European Union or Eurozone. Since the justifications share common semantic subsets (e.g., euro as official currency, Eurozone membership), none of the pairs are disjoint.
