Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., eye muscle fatigue, reduced blinking frequency, blue light emission, improper focus distance, and a statement from the American Academy of Ophthalmology) that does not overlap with the others in terms of supporting the claim. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
