Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the arguments about the primary official language and the education system both contribute to the claim by highlighting different aspects of why English is widely spoken in Ireland. Similarly, the census data and the native language arguments both support the claim by providing evidence of widespread English proficiency. Therefore, there is overlap in the semantic content of the justifications with respect to the claim.
