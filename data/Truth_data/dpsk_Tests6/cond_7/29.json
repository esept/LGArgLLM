Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification discusses the general historical challenges faced by the books in various countries, the second focuses on Ireland's specific censorship history, and the third provides a specific example of 'Ulysses' being banned elsewhere. While all support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping reasoning.
