Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., repeal of historical bans, rarity of challenges, legal protections, education policies, public records, lack of a comprehensive list) supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning. Thus, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
