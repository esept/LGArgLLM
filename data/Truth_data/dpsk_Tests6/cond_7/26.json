Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are all distinct in their reasoning but collectively support the claim. For example, one argument cites scientific studies, another mentions traditional medicine practices, another discusses the composition of pangolin scales, and others reference health organizations, regulatory approvals, and peer-reviewed literature. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that overlaps in meaning when supporting the claim.
