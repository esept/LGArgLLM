Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all share a common semantic subset related to the biological and taxonomic classification of toads as a subset of frogs. They overlap in discussing the morphological, behavioral, and genetic traits that place toads within the broader category of frogs. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
