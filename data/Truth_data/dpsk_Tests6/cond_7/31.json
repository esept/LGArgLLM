Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the arguments about forensic evidence linking Hauptmann to the crime and the historical consensus among experts both contribute to the conclusion that Hauptmann was the perpetrator, overlapping in their support for the claim. However, there are pairs of arguments (e.g., the argument about the case being officially closed and the argument about the absence of credible alternative suspects) that are semantically disjoint as they address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in their justifications.
