Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., physiological limitations, lack of evidence, cognitive abilities, mimicry without understanding, and conversational ability). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
