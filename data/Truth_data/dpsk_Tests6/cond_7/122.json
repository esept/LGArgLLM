Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the failure of Bem's study to replicate and the lack of robust evidence for precognition. They all contribute to the claim by emphasizing different aspects of replication failure, scientific standards, or methodological flaws, but none are disjoint in their support of the claim.
