Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in meaning, as they all revolve around the lack of scientific evidence or validation for cryptids. For example, the first argument ("Cryptids, by definition, are creatures whose existence is not substantiated by scientific evidence.") and the second argument ("Mainstream science requires reproducible evidence and peer-reviewed studies to confirm the existence of any species, which cryptids lack.") both emphasize the absence of scientific substantiation. Similarly, other arguments also highlight the lack of empirical evidence, peer-reviewed documentation, or the failure to meet scientific standards. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
