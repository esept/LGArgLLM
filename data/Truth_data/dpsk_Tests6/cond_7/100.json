Let's analyze the justifications for each pair of arguments to determine if at least one pair is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

1. A1 (Official labor statistics...) vs A2 (Economic pressures...):
   - A1: Focuses on statistical evidence of increased working hours.
   - A2: Focuses on economic reasons for increased working hours.
   - These are different aspects supporting the same claim - not disjoint.

2. A1 vs A3 (Historical data...):
   - A1: Statistical evidence of increased working hours.
   - A3: Decreased leisure time implying increased working hours.
   - Both relate to time allocation changes - not disjoint.

3. A1 vs A4 (Gig economy...):
   - A1: General statistics on working hours.
   - A4: Specific change in work patterns.
   - Both about working time changes - not disjoint.

4. A1 vs A5 (Surveys report...):
   - A1: General working hours statistics.
   - A5: Overtime specifically.
   - Both about increased work time - not disjoint.

5. A2 vs A3:
   - A2: Economic reasons for working more.
   - A3: Leisure time decrease.
   - Different angles but both support claim - not disjoint.

6. A2 vs A4:
   - A2: Economic pressures.
   - A4: Gig economy changes.
   - Different aspects of modern work life - not disjoint.

7. A2 vs A5:
   - A2: Economic reasons.
   - A5: Overtime statistics.
   - Different support types but related - not disjoint.

8. A3 vs A4:
   - A3: Leisure time decrease.
   - A4: Gig economy.
   - Different aspects - potentially disjoint as gig economy doesn't directly relate to leisure time measurement.

9. A3 vs A5:
   - A3: Leisure time.
   - A5: Overtime.
   - Related concepts - not disjoint.

10. A4 vs A5:
    - A4: Gig economy hours.
    - A5: Overtime.
    - Different types of extended work - not disjoint.

The pair A3 (leisure time) and A4 (gig economy) appear to be semantically disjoint as their justifications don't share common semantic ground in supporting the claim - one is about time allocation measurement, the other about work structure changes.

Result: true
Justification: The justifications for A3 (historical leisure time data) and A4 (gig economy work arrangements) are semantically disjoint as they address different aspects without overlapping support for the claim.
