Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share the common semantic theme that Type 1 diabetes is not caused by dietary factors, but rather by autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors. For example, the first and second arguments both mention the autoimmune nature of Type 1 diabetes and its unrelatedness to diet, while the third and fourth arguments further reinforce this by stating the lack of a direct link to sugar and distinguishing Type 1 from Type 2 diabetes. The fifth argument also aligns by noting the onset in childhood unrelated to diet. Thus, there is overlap in their justifications supporting the claim.
