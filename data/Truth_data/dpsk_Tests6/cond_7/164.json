Result: true
Justification: All justifications provided for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each justification presents a distinct reason (e.g., wardrobes being ordinary furniture, lack of scientific evidence, mundane physical outcome, lack of historical records, fictional trope) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning.
