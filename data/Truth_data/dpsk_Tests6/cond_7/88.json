Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the arguments about the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and labor unions both relate to regulatory and collective bargaining efforts to reduce working hours, which overlaps in their contribution to the claim. Similarly, the arguments about technological advancements and GDP per capita both relate to economic factors enabling reduced working hours. Since there are overlapping semantic subsets in the justifications, the result is true.
