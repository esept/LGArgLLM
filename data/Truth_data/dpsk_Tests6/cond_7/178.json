Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the limitations of current lie detection technologies (e.g., reliance on indirect indicators, influence of unrelated factors, lack of perfect accuracy). These shared themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
