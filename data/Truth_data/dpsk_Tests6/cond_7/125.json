Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common theme of discussing the lack of strong scientific evidence linking breastfeeding to significant cognitive benefits, often referencing studies or expert opinions that control for confounding variables. For example, the first and second arguments both mention the role of socioeconomic factors and maternal education in diminishing the observed cognitive benefits of breastfeeding. The third and fourth arguments similarly focus on the absence of significant long-term cognitive differences, supported by expert opinions and twin studies, respectively. Thus, there is semantic overlap among the justifications in supporting the claim.
