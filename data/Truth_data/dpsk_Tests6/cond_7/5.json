Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the argument about London's airport system (Heathrow) does not overlap with the argument about the UK's visa policies and historical ties. Similarly, the argument about London being a global financial hub is distinct from the argument about the English language's global dominance. Each justification provides a unique reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
