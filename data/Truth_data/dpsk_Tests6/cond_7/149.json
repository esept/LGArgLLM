Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument cites nominal GDP per capita, another cites median household income, and another cites average wage levels. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
