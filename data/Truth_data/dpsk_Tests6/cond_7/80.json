Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention factors like advancements in manufacturing, economies of scale, and global supply chains as reasons for the decrease in prices. These overlapping themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
