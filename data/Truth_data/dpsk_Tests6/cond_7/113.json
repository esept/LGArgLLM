Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided are semantically related to the claim and overlap in their support of the claim. They all discuss the context of Nixon's statement "I am not a crook" in relation to the Watergate scandal, either by mentioning the timing, the allegations, the public interpretation, historical records, or the phrase's linkage to the scandal. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
