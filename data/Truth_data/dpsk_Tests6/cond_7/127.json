Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the failure of replication studies to confirm the original findings, while the second argument cites neuroscientific evidence that does not support a causal link. These justifications address different aspects (replication vs. neuroscientific evidence) and do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
