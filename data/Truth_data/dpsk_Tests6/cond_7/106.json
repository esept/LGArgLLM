Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the deterministic 50% gene sharing between parents and children, the second contrasts the probabilistic nature of sibling gene sharing with the deterministic parent-child relationship, and the third highlights the fixed proportion in parent-child relationships versus the variable range in siblings. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
