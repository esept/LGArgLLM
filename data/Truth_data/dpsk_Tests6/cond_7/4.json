Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to the depiction of King Henry VIII with a dagger in the portrait. The first argument directly states the dagger is visible in the artwork, the second provides historical context about his depiction with weapons, and the third confirms the object is a dagger through artistic analysis. All contribute to supporting the claim by reinforcing the idea that King Henry is reaching for a dagger in the portrait.
