Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic theme: they argue that diseases require specific medical treatments or biological processes that cannot be addressed by touch alone. There is significant overlap in their reasoning, as they all reference medical science, biological mechanisms, or evidence-based practices to support the claim. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
