Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and third arguments both reference Project Mogul, a classified balloon project, as the source of the debris. Similarly, the second and fourth arguments both discuss the nature of the debris (rubber strips and foil) and the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial technology. These overlaps indicate shared semantic subsets that contribute to supporting the claim.
