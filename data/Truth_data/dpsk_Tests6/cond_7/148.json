Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. They all emphasize the distinction between short-term weather fluctuations (like a cold day) and long-term global climate trends (global warming). None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
