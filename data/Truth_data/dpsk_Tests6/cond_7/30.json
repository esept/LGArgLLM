Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap semantically. For example, the first and third arguments both discuss the need to exchange dollars for euros in France, and the second and fourth arguments both discuss the need to exchange dollars for krone in Denmark. These overlaps mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
