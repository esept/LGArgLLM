Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common theme of supporting the claim by providing reasons why ninjas would have worn clothing other than black for practical camouflage and historical accuracy. For example, multiple arguments reference the impracticality of black clothing in natural environments and the historical prevalence of other colors like dark blue or brown. This overlap in meaning indicates that the justifications are not disjoint.
