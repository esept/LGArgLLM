Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on self-reported feelings of power and risk tolerance, the second on the theoretical framework of embodied cognition, and the third on hormonal changes. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
