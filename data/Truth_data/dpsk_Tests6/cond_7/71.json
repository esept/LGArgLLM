Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct reasons supporting the claim. For example, one justification cites historical records of mass production in California, another mentions the absence of fortune cookies in traditional Chinese cuisine, and another refers to the development of the modern design in California. These justifications do not overlap in meaning but collectively support the claim.
