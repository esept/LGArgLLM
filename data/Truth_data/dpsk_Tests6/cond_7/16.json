Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to statistical data and reports (e.g., CDC, WHO, OECD, public health reports, survey data) that support the claim that the U.S. has higher smoking rates than Spain. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
