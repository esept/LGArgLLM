Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the critical acclaim and recognition of Schindler's List (e.g., Academy Awards, AFI criteria, film studies citations). Additionally, the historical significance and cultural impact of the film are mentioned in multiple justifications. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
