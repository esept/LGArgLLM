Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., Spanish not universal, indigenous languages, Portuguese in Brazil, English dominance in the U.S., local languages in non-Spanish-speaking countries) supporting the claim that Hispanics do not share a single common language. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
