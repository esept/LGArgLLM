Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim, which is that West Virginia has the highest obesity rate among U.S. states based on various data sources (CDC, statistical analyses, comparative studies, and surveys). None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
