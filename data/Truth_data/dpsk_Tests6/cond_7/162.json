Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (niche sport globally, not ranking in top sports, physical demands, and cultural significance without majority appeal) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. All justifications independently support the claim without sharing a common semantic subset.
