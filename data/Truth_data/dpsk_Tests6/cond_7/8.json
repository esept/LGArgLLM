Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument cites per capita consumption statistics, while the second focuses on the total market volume. The third and fourth arguments discuss cultural preferences and the popularity of craft beer, respectively. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim.
