Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., obligate carnivores, lactose intolerance, kidney function, toxicity of other beverages, natural hydration needs) why cats should only drink water, with no overlap in meaning.
