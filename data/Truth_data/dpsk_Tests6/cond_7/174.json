Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, "A balanced diet provides all essential nutrients required for bodily functions, supporting overall health" and "Nutritional deficiencies caused by an imbalanced diet can lead to chronic diseases and impaired immune function" both relate to the necessity of nutrients for health, indicating overlap in meaning. Similarly, other arguments also intersect in their support for the claim through themes like prevention of diseases and adherence to scientific guidelines. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
