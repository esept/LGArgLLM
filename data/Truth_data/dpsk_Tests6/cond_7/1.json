Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic theme that dreams and wishes made during them lack the power or influence to guarantee success in reality. They overlap in meaning by emphasizing the subjective, non-causal, or unreliable nature of dreams and the lack of scientific or practical basis for such wishes to affect outcomes. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
