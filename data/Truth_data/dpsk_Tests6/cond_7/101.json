Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that Muslims are a minority in all EU countries. The justifications reference different sources (Eurostat, Pew Research Center, official census data, demographic studies, EU-wide surveys) but all support the same underlying point about the minority status of Muslims in the EU. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
