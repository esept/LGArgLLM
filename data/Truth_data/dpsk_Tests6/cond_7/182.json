Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content, as they all provide different pieces of evidence (e.g., WHO data, per capita consumption, public health policies, cultural attitudes, CDC data) that collectively support the claim about higher smoking rates in the United States compared to Russia. However, there is at least one pair of arguments (e.g., the first and second arguments) whose justifications are not disjoint, as both refer to statistical data (WHO and global health statistics) that support the claim in a similar way.
