Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, arguments about Mexico's higher obesity rates and dietary habits (A1, A3) and Ireland's public health policies (A4) overlap in discussing factors contributing to the obesity rates. However, there are pairs like A1 (WHO data) and A5 (demographic studies) that are semantically disjoint as they address different aspects (global rankings vs. urban population data) without overlapping in meaning with respect to the claim. Thus, at least one pair is disjoint.
