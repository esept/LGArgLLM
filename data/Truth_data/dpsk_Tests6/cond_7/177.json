Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim by referencing different aspects of French law, society, and international agreements that collectively reduce the number of illegal films. For example, arguments about strict but clear laws, classification systems, human rights agreements, and societal values all contribute to the same conclusion that very few films are illegal in France. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
