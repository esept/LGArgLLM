```
Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to UK laws and regulations (e.g., Data Protection Act 2018, GDPR, safeguarding policies, Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, Human Rights Act 1998) that restrict or prohibit the recording of children without consent. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
