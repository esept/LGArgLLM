Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint, as they all relate to the same overarching theme of decreased food affordability in America. However, they each provide distinct supporting evidence (e.g., CPI increases, income stagnation, food insecurity rates, etc.), so there is no semantic overlap in their justifications. Thus, the condition is satisfied (at least one pair is disjoint).
