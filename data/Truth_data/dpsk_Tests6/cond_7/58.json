Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference comparisons of U.S. incomes to those in high-income countries (e.g., Switzerland, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark) and discuss factors like median household income, average wage, and purchasing power parity. These justifications share common themes and are not semantically disjoint.
