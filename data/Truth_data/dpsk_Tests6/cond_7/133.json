Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the high humidity in Hong Kong due to its climate, monsoon season, and coastal location. These justifications are not semantically disjoint as they all contribute to supporting the claim by providing different reasons for the constant humidity in Hong Kong.
