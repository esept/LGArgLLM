Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all focus on different aspects of the lack of consensus regarding the designer of the first American flag. For example, one argument mentions the lack of definitive evidence in historical records, another mentions the multiple individuals credited, another the lack of documentation by the Continental Congress, another the ongoing debate among scholars, and another the lack of primary source evidence. While they all support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping justifications, making them semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
