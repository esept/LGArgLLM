Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of Donald Sutherland's life (career, physical features, personal life, online presence, political views) without overlapping in meaning. For example, the justification about his acting career does not share a common semantic subset with the justification about his political views.
