Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., current observations, rarity of conditions, Earth's unique position, Fermi Paradox, complexity of biosphere), and none of them share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in meaning.
