Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that providing video recordings of lectures does not significantly impact class attendance. Each justification provides slightly different reasoning (e.g., valuing in-person interaction, structured learning environment, academic performance, supplementary use, active participation), but they all converge on the same conclusion. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
