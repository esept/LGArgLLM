Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (historical data, cigarette smoking, improved diagnostics, occupational exposure) for the increase in lung cancer rates, and none of these reasons overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
