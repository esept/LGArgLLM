Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All arguments share the common semantic subset that Donald Trump was the most recent U.S. president not selected as Time's Person of the Year, and they provide overlapping evidence (e.g., Time's selections for recent years, Trump's presidency timeline) to support this claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are completely disjoint with respect to the claim.
