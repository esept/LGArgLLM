Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that no bodies were buried in the Hoover Dam, as they all reference historical records, official reports, construction protocols, or modern investigations confirming the removal or absence of human remains. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
