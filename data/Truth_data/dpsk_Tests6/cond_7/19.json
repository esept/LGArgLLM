Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or piece of evidence (e.g., Gini coefficient, size of the middle class, poverty rates, taxation policies, historical economic policies, wage disparity) to support the claim that US incomes are less unequal than those in Brazil. None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
