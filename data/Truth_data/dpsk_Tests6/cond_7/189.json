Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and fourth arguments both discuss survivorship bias and its impact on evaluating investor performance, sharing a common semantic subset. Similarly, the second and third arguments both reference academic or theoretical perspectives (finance research and the Efficient Market Hypothesis) that challenge the notion of consistent outperformance. Thus, there is overlap in meaning among some pairs of arguments.
