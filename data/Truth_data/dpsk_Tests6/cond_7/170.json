Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim that the Bermuda Triangle narrative is fabricated, such as lack of statistical evidence, debunked disappearances, sensationalist media influence, modern technology reducing incidents, and arbitrary boundaries. None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
