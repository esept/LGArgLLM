Result: false  
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap in their semantic content regarding snowfall comparisons between Barrie and Montreal. For example, the arguments about Barrie's lake-effect snow and Montreal's continental climate both discuss climatic influences on snowfall, which are related. Similarly, the arguments about historical data and proximity to water bodies both contribute to the claim by providing evidence or reasons for higher snowfall in Barrie. Thus, no pair of arguments is entirely disjoint in their justifications.
