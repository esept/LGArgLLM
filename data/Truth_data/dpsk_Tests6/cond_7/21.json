Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (cultural preferences, affordability, industrialization, religious/cultural diversity, marketing) for the higher consumption of chicken compared to pork in the United States. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
