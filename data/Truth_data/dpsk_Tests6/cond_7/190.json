Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both refer to the ability of certain birds to understand and use human language (English), with the first focusing on mimicry and comprehension by African Grey Parrots and the second citing scientific studies on word-meaning association and contextual response. These justifications share a common semantic subset related to birds' language abilities.
