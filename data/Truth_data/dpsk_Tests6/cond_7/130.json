Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple justifications mention aspects of the university's reputation (e.g., being well-known in Wales, having a reputable law school, and ranking highly among undergraduate institutions), which are all related to the claim's assertion about the university's fame and ranking. Therefore, the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
