Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to Baumeister's ego depletion experiments and their implications for executive function. The first argument directly discusses the experimental results, the second links these results to broader psychological concepts, and the third mentions the influence of Baumeister's work on subsequent research. All contribute to supporting the claim by overlapping in their focus on ego depletion and executive function.
