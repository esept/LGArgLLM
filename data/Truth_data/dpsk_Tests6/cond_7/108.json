Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the claim that tiger sharks cannot stop swimming. They all discuss the biological necessity of continuous swimming for respiration (obligate ram ventilation) and the lack of alternative breathing mechanisms in tiger sharks. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
