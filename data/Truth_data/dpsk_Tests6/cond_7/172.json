Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the collaborative effort involving Francis Hopkinson, the second on the 19th-century myth-making pattern, and the third on the lack of official records mentioning Betsy Ross. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
