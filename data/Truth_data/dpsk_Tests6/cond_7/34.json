Result: true
Justification: Each argument presents a distinct diet (Mediterranean, DASH, intermittent fasting, plant-based, high-protein) with its own unique justification for causing weight loss. The justifications do not overlap semantically, as each focuses on different mechanisms or benefits (e.g., cardiovascular health, blood pressure control, eating windows, metabolic benefits, satiety). Thus, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
