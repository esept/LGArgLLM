Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the claim by providing neuroscientific evidence against left-brain or right-brain dominance. They all discuss findings from brain imaging studies, cognitive tasks, meta-analyses, educational research, clinical studies, and modern neuroimaging techniques that collectively refute the distinction between left-brained and right-brained thinkers. None of the pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
