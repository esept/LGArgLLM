Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both reference the lack of scientific or biological evidence for dragons, which overlaps in meaning. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both discuss the absence of credible empirical support for dragons, which also overlaps. Since there are overlapping semantic subsets among the justifications, the result is false (i.e., they are not all disjoint).
