Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to geographical and climatic factors that explain why Barrie receives more snowfall than Montreal. These include Barrie's location in a snowbelt region, lake-effect snow, historical data supporting higher snowfall, and comparative analysis of climatic influences (e.g., proximity to water, urban vs. rural settings). The arguments collectively support the claim through overlapping reasons centered on these factors.
