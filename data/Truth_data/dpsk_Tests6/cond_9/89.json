Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on Dirac's Nobel Prize win for his contributions to quantum mechanics, the second on his birthplace confirming his British nationality, and the third on the criteria for the Nobel Prize unrelated to religious or ethnic background. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without a unifying semantic intersection.
