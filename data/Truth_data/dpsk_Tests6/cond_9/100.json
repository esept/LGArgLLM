Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core supporting the claim that people in England spend more time working now than in the past. They collectively point to increased working hours, economic pressures reducing leisure time, and modern work arrangements leading to longer or more irregular hours. Each justification aligns with the overall trend of more time spent working, reinforcing the claim from different angles (statistics, economic factors, historical data, work arrangements, and surveys).
