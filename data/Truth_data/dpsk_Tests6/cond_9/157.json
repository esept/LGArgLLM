Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that links dreams of future success to increased motivation through various psychological and neurological mechanisms (e.g., reward system activation, self-efficacy reinforcement, mental rehearsal, dopamine boost, goal-directed arousal, and neural pathway influence). Each justification supports the claim by explaining how dreams can lead to motivation, albeit through slightly different but overlapping pathways.
