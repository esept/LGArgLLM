Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by providing statistical and comparative data showing higher smoking rates in the U.S. compared to Spain. Each justification references authoritative sources (CDC, WHO, OECD, public health reports, survey data) and consistently highlights the higher prevalence or consumption of smoking in the U.S. relative to Spain.
