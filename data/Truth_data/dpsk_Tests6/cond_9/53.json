Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that truthful statements are protected and cannot be considered defamatory under U.S. law, as they either explicitly state that truth is a defense, or that defamation requires false statements, or that truthful speech is protected by the First Amendment. This consistent theme across all arguments supports the claim.
