Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Each justification addresses a different aspect of Donald Sutherland's life and career (acting career, distinctive looks, marriages and children, online presence, political views), but there is no single overlapping theme that unifies all of them to support the claim collectively. Each argument stands on its own merit without intersecting semantically with the others.
