Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim. While they address Iceland's small size and pleasant living conditions, they do not cover other aspects of the claim such as English being spoken, most people being Christian, or the annexation by a great continental power. There is no common intersection of all justifications that supports the entire claim.
