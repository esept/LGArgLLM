Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the semantic core that 'SOS' was chosen for its Morse code utility (distinct pattern, ease of transmission/recognition) and not as an acronym or abbreviation for any phrase. The historical records and maritime/telegraphic documents consistently support this interpretation, and the later backronyms are explicitly dismissed as unrelated to the original meaning.
