Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim that the Lindbergh kidnapping case was solved. They collectively emphasize the legal resolution through Hauptmann's conviction, forensic evidence linking him to the crime, the lack of substantial evidence for alternative theories, the official closure of the case, and the historical consensus among experts. While some justifications focus on different aspects (e.g., forensic evidence vs. historical consensus), they all converge on the idea that the case was solved with Hauptmann as the perpetrator, despite the existence of alternative theories.
