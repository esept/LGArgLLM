Result: false  
Justification: While all arguments support the claim that you pay with euros in Germany and France, the argument about Switzerland is not fully supported. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union and does not use the euro as its official currency (it uses the Swiss franc). Therefore, there is no common semantic intersection across all justifications for the claim as stated.
