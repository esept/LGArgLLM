Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core related to the mechanisms by which sitting close to the television can cause eyestrain, such as eye muscle fatigue, reduced blinking, blue light exposure, and improper focus distance. Each argument supports the claim by highlighting different aspects of these mechanisms, but they all converge on the idea that proximity to the screen leads to temporary visual discomfort or strain.
