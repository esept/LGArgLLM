Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core centered on the lack of scientific evidence or validation for cryptids. They collectively emphasize that cryptids lack substantiation through reproducible evidence, peer-reviewed studies, formal documentation, or adherence to the scientific method, and that many claims have been debunked. This unified reasoning supports the claim that no cryptid shown by scientists has been proven to be completely real.
