Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that premature reliance on uncertain outcomes (counting unhatched chickens) leads to failure due to overconfidence, poor planning, misallocation of resources, or distraction from necessary preparations. This aligns with the claim's assertion that counting chickens before they hatch results in failure.
