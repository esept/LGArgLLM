Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first argument highlights the ability of certain parrot species to mimic and comprehend human language, while the second argument provides evidence from scientific studies that birds can associate words with meanings and respond contextually. Both justifications converge on the idea that some birds can understand and use human language (English), which directly supports the claim.
