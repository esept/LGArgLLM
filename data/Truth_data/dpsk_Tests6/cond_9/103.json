Result: true  
Justification: All justifications collectively support the claim by addressing each component: Dominica's former British status (independence in 1978), its non-aligned status (membership in the Non-Aligned Movement), the presence of an airport (Douglas-Charles Airport), and the large Roman Catholic population (predominant religion). There is a shared semantic core that aligns with the claim.
