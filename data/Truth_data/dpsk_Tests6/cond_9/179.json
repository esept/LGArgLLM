Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by highlighting the safety and low risk of nuclear power compared to other energy sources. Each argument provides evidence from reputable organizations (IAEA, WHO, IPCC) or statistical data to show that nuclear power has fewer fatalities, lower health impacts, and robust safety features, aligning with the claim's assertion of its safety and lack of scientific consensus against it.
