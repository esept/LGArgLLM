Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core: modern neuroscientific evidence (e.g., fMRI, PET scans, meta-analyses, clinical studies) consistently shows that cognitive functions involve integrated activity across both hemispheres, refuting the idea of left-brain or right-brain dominance. Each justification reinforces this central point with complementary evidence or perspectives.
