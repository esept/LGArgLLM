Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that Hong Kong's climate or geographical features contribute to high humidity levels. The first argument mentions the humid subtropical climate, the second focuses on the monsoon season, and the third highlights the coastal location. Despite different specific reasons, they all converge on the general idea that Hong Kong's environment leads to high humidity, supporting the claim. Thus, all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
