Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides data or reasoning about smoking rates or behaviors in the United States and Russia, often citing authoritative sources (e.g., WHO, CDC, global health statistics). The common themes include prevalence of smoking, per capita consumption, public health policies, and cultural attitudes, which all directly support the claim about comparative smoking rates.
