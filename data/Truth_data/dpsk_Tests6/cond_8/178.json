Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument highlights a different limitation or challenge in machine-based lie detection, such as reliance on indirect indicators, inability to model complex human behavior, lack of perfect accuracy, or variability in human responses. These ideas intersect in supporting the claim that no machine can rigorously detect all kinds of lies. For example, arguments about physiological responses being unreliable overlap with those about indirect indicators, and arguments about human complexity overlap with those about behavioral variability. Thus, all pairs share common reasoning patterns supporting the claim.
