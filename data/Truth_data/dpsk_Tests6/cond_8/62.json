Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the negative consequences of prematurely assuming or relying on uncertain outcomes (unhatched chickens), such as overconfidence, poor planning, misallocation of resources, or distraction from necessary preparations, all of which lead to failure. The core idea of counting unhatched chickens as a cause of failure is consistently present across all justifications.
