Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses aspects of French law, censorship, or societal values that contribute to the rarity of films being illegal in France. For example, the legalization of previously banned films, the classification system, international agreements, the official list of prohibited films, societal values, and judicial oversight all intersect in supporting the claim that very few films are still illegal to show in France.
