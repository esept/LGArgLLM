Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss Baumeister's experiments and their implications for ego depletion and executive function. The first and third arguments both mention Baumeister's work and its impact on understanding self-control. The second and third arguments both relate to the broader psychological implications of ego depletion, even if the mechanism is debated. Thus, all pairs overlap in their justifications supporting the claim.
