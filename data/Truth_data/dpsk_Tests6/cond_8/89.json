Result: false
Justification: The justifications do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. The first justification focuses on Dirac's Nobel Prize for contributions to quantum mechanics, the second on his birthplace confirming his British nationality, and the third on the Nobel Prize being awarded based on scientific achievements rather than religious or ethnic background. There is no overlap in semantic content between these justifications in relation to the claim.
