Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that cryptids lack the scientific evidence required to be proven real. Each argument reinforces this idea by highlighting different aspects of the scientific process (e.g., lack of peer-reviewed studies, absence of formal documentation, debunked sightings, or unmet burden of proof). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their core reasoning supporting the claim.
