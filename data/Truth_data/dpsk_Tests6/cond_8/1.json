Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes that dreams or wishes made during dreams lack the causal power, intentionality, or reliability to influence real-world success. Common themes include the subjective nature of dreams, the absence of scientific evidence, the randomness of dream content, and the necessity of real-world actions for success. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects on at least one of these ideas.
