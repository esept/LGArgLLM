Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the passive nature of mirrors and the lack of empirical evidence or scientific basis for any effects caused by placing a mirror by the bed. The common themes include the absence of physical or chemical changes, lack of measurable effects on health or well-being, and the unsupported nature of superstitions regarding mirrors. These shared ideas ensure that every pair of arguments intersects semantically in supporting the claim.
