Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument highlights different aspects of rugby's limited popularity globally, such as niche participation rates, lack of top rankings in major countries, physical demands limiting appeal, and even in culturally significant countries, it does not attract a majority. These justifications collectively support the claim by reinforcing the idea that rugby is not widely loved by most people in any country.
