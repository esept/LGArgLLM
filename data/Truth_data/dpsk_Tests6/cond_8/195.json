Result: false
Justification: While all arguments support the claim that the rate of lung cancer has increased over time among American men, their justifications do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first argument cites historical data from the CDC, the second links the increase to cigarette smoking, the third attributes it to improved diagnostic techniques, and the fourth mentions occupational exposure to carcinogens. These are distinct reasons without overlapping semantic content in their justifications.
