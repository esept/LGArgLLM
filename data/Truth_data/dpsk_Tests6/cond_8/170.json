Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides a different reason why the narrative of the Bermuda Triangle is fabricated, but they all converge on the idea that the legend lacks factual or statistical support. For example, arguments about statistical evidence, debunked disappearances, sensationalist media, modern technology, and arbitrary boundaries all reinforce the claim that the narrative is not credible. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects in their shared goal of undermining the legend's validity.
