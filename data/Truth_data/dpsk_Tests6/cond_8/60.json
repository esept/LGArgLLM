Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to a different aspect of why birds cannot achieve fluency in English (physiological limitations, lack of evidence, cognitive abilities, lack of understanding, and conversational inability), but all are interconnected in supporting the central claim that birds cannot be fluent in English. For example, the lack of physiological structures ties to the inability to produce speech sounds, which connects to the lack of evidence and the absence of understanding or conversational ability. Thus, all justifications reinforce the same overarching idea.
