Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping semantic justifications (e.g., A1 and A2 both reference consumption statistics), others do not. For example, A3 discusses cultural traditions favoring wine or spirits, which does not directly overlap with the market volume argument in A2 or the craft beer argument in A4. Thus, not all pairs share semantic intersections.
