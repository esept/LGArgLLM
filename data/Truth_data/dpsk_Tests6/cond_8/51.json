Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common semantic justification that historical records and evidence are insufficient or conflicting, preventing a consensus on the designer of the first American flag. Each argument reinforces this central idea, either by pointing to the lack of definitive evidence, the existence of multiple claimants without conclusive proof, the absence of documentation, ongoing debates among scholars, or the lack of primary sources. Thus, their justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
