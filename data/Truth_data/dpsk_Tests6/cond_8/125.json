Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument cites scientific studies or authoritative sources (e.g., WHO, meta-analyses, AAP, twin studies) that collectively emphasize the lack of strong evidence linking breastfeeding to significant cognitive advantages. The common themes include the modest or negligible impact on IQ, confounding factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, maternal education), and the absence of long-term cognitive differences in controlled studies. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects in their reasoning to support the claim.
