Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that scientific evidence and medical consensus support the claim that knuckle cracking does not cause harm or negative health outcomes. Each argument reinforces this idea by citing different aspects of the evidence (e.g., lack of arthritis link, mechanism of sound production, long-term studies, medical consensus, grip strength, and peer-reviewed research). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their support for the claim.
