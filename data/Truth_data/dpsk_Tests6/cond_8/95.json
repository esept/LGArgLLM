Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that cage-free hens have greater freedom of movement compared to caged hens. The first argument emphasizes the freedom within a barn or enclosed area, while the second mentions outdoor access as part of welfare standards. Both justifications support the claim by highlighting aspects of freedom and access for cage-free hens.
