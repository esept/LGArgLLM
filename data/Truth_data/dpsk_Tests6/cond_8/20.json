Result: false
Justification: While all arguments support the claim that the Boston Red Sox are notable for raising ALS awareness, having a long history, and state-of-the-art training facilities, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about the ALS awareness (Ice Bucket Challenge) does not semantically overlap with the argument about the team's multiple World Series championships. Similarly, the argument about the team's global popularity does not directly overlap with the argument about Fenway Park being a historic landmark. Thus, not all pairs share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
