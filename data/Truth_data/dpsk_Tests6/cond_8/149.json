Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common theme of comparing economic indicators (GDP per capita, median household income, average wage level, productivity, etc.) between the US and Japan, which directly supports the claim about per capita income differences. Each pair of arguments overlaps in discussing aspects of income or economic performance that favor the US over Japan.
