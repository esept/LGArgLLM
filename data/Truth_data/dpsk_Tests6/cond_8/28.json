Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided all support the claim that Germany, France, and Switzerland use euros, but they do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument mentions that these countries are members or closely associated with the EU, the second focuses on the adoption of the euro in 2002, and the third emphasizes the euro as the sole legal tender. While they all relate to the claim, they do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
