Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that certain birds (specifically parrots) can mimic and understand human language, including English. The first argument mentions African Grey Parrots demonstrating this ability, while the second argument cites scientific studies showing birds can associate words with meanings. Both justifications support the claim by highlighting birds' linguistic capabilities in relation to English.
