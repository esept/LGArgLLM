Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic theme that global warming is about long-term climate trends, not short-term weather events. Each justification reinforces this idea by emphasizing the distinction between weather and climate, the long-term nature of climate change, or the irrelevance of local temperature variations to global trends. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their core reasoning.
