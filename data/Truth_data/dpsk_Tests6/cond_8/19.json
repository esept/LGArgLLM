Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to income inequality metrics (e.g., Gini coefficient, middle class size, poverty rates, progressive taxation, wage disparity). For example, the Gini coefficient and middle class size are both measures of income distribution, while poverty rates and progressive taxation are linked to economic policies affecting inequality. The arguments consistently compare these factors between the US and Brazil, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
