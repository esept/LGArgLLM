Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping justifications (e.g., cultural preferences and dietary habits in A1 and A4, affordability in A2 and industrialization in A3), not all pairs have a clear semantic intersection. For example, A2 (affordability) and A5 (marketing and availability) do not share a direct common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications. Therefore, not all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications.
