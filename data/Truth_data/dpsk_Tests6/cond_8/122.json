Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the failure of Bem's study to replicate, the lack of robust evidence for precognition, and the scientific standards (e.g., replication, extraordinary evidence) that the study failed to meet. The common themes include replication failure, lack of evidence, and scientific validity, ensuring semantic intersection across all pairs.
