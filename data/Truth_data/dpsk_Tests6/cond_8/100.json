Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to the claim. For example, A1 and A3 both reference statistical data (labor statistics and historical data) to support the claim. A2 and A4 both discuss economic factors (economic pressures and the gig economy) leading to longer working hours. A5 overlaps with A1 and A3 by referencing surveys and data trends. Thus, all justifications intersect semantically in supporting the claim.
