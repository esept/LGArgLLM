Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the definition of the average (mean) implies that the majority of numbers cannot exceed it. The justifications either explicitly reference the definition of the mean or rely on logical consequences of this definition (e.g., balancing excess, median comparison, statistical principles). Thus, there is semantic overlap in all pairs.
