Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references historical evidence (e.g., works by scholars like Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, Bede, and Isidore of Seville) or the continuity of spherical Earth knowledge from ancient times to the Middle Ages. The common theme is the well-documented belief in a spherical Earth among medieval scholars, supported by texts, navigation, and astronomy, as well as the debunking of the flat Earth myth.
