Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping justifications (e.g., A1 and A3 both mention London's global prominence, and A2 and A5 both mention accessibility factors), not all pairs share a common idea. For example, A4's focus on European vs. non-European tourism does not directly overlap with A1's focus on airport infrastructure or A3's focus on business travel.
