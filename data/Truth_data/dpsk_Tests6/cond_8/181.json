Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references specific UK laws or regulations (e.g., Data Protection Act 2018, GDPR, Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, Human Rights Act 1998) that collectively emphasize the legal restrictions and privacy protections against recording children without consent. The common theme across all justifications is the legal framework in the UK that prohibits or restricts such recordings, ensuring semantic overlap.
