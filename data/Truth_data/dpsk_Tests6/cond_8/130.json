Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the argument about the mix of classical and modern architecture does not overlap semantically with the argument about the law school's reputation. Similarly, the argument about the university's ranking does not share semantic overlap with the argument about its contributions to higher education and research. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
