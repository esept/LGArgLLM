Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that medical science and biological processes do not support the idea that touch alone can cure diseases. Each argument emphasizes the need for specific, evidence-based treatments and the complexity of disease mechanisms, which cannot be addressed by mere physical contact. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their reasoning against the claim.
