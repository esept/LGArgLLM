Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Canada's legal and cultural framework strongly protects freedom of expression, making book bans rare. Each justification either references legal protections (e.g., Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, high threshold for bans), lack of centralized censorship, or historical and judicial trends favoring free speech. These overlapping themes ensure that every pair of arguments has at least one shared semantic justification in relation to the claim.
