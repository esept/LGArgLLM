Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the collaborative effort involving Francis Hopkinson, the second on 19th-century myth-making, and the third on the absence of official records mentioning Betsy Ross. These are distinct points without semantic overlap.
