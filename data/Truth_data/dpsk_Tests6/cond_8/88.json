Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to the claim. For example, the reduction in working hours is supported by historical data (A1), legal regulations (A2), technological advancements (A3), modern work arrangements (A4), labor union efforts (A5), and economic trends (A6). While each argument provides a distinct justification, they all intersect on the overarching theme of factors contributing to the decline in working hours in America. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
