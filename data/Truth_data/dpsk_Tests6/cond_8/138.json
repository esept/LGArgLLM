Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument supports different aspects of the claim (size, economic importance, tourism, and expensive rents), but they all collectively contribute to the overall description of Chicago as a big, diverse, economically significant city with high tourism and expensive rents. There is no pair of arguments that lacks a common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
