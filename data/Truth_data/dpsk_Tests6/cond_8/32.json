Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument reinforces the idea that toads are biologically classified as frogs, either by emphasizing taxonomic inclusion (e.g., "subset of frogs," "within the broader category of frogs"), common naming conventions (e.g., "'toad' is a common name for certain frog species"), or shared traits (e.g., "anatomical and genetic traits"). The justifications consistently align with the claim's core idea.
