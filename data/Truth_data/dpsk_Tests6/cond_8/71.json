Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides historical or cultural evidence supporting the idea that fortune cookies originated in California, not China. For example, arguments about historical records, lack of traditional Chinese origin, and commercialization in California all intersect in their focus on the non-Chinese and Californian origins of fortune cookies.
