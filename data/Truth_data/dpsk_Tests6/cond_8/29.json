Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the historical context of book bans or censorship, particularly in Ireland or other countries, and the controversial themes or content of the mentioned books. For example, the first and second arguments both mention the controversial themes of the books and Ireland's history of censorship. The third argument also ties into this by discussing the historical challenges faced by 'Ulysses', which is consistent with the themes of censorship and controversial content mentioned in the other arguments.
