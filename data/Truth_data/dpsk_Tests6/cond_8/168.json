Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument reinforces the idea that vaccines do not permanently modify DNA by providing different but related scientific reasons (e.g., immune system stimulation, mRNA degradation, absence of necessary enzymes, scientific consensus, lack of interaction with the nucleus, and absence of peer-reviewed evidence). These justifications collectively support the claim through interconnected reasoning.
