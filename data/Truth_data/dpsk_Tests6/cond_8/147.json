Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses a specific aspect of how food affordability has decreased, such as rising food prices outpacing income growth, inflation-adjusted purchasing power decline, or increased food insecurity. These ideas collectively support the claim by highlighting different facets of the same underlying issueâ€”reduced affordability of food in America.
