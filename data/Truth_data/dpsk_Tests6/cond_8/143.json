Justification: All arguments share the common idea that lawyers in the U.S. are legally and ethically prohibited from giving false evidence to exonerate their clients. Each justification references legal or ethical frameworks (e.g., ABA Model Rules, perjury laws, legal ethics, judicial mechanisms, adversarial system principles, state bar disciplinary actions) that collectively reinforce this prohibition. The semantic overlap is clear as all justifications converge on the same core concept of prohibition against false evidence by lawyers.
