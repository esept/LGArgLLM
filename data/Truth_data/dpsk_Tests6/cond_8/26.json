Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that pangolin scales lack scientific or empirical evidence supporting their medicinal efficacy. Each justification either references the absence of clinical trials, the composition of keratin (which has no therapeutic effects), or the lack of recognition by health organizations or regulatory bodies. These overlapping themes collectively reinforce the claim that pangolin scales are not effective medicine.
