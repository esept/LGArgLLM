Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that modern brain imaging and neuroscientific research refute the idea of left-brain or right-brain dominance. Each argument emphasizes different aspects (e.g., fMRI/PET scans, cognitive tasks, meta-analyses, split-brain studies, creativity/analytical thinking), but all converge on the conclusion that hemispheric dominance is not supported by evidence. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their core reasoning against the claim of left-brained or right-brained thinkers.
