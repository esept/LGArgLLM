Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument refers to historical evidence, the material properties of parchment, or contemporary accounts confirming that the original US Constitution was written on parchment. For example, the first and second arguments both cite historical records (the National Archives and general historical records), while the third and fourth arguments both mention the suitability of parchment for important documents (durability and contemporary practices). Thus, every pair has at least one common idea supporting the claim.
