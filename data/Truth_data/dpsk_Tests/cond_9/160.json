Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of all P-type arguments consistently argue that the cost of food in Canada has increased since 1970, not decreased. They share a common semantic core of rising food prices due to factors like inflation, global influences, and declining affordability, which directly contradicts the claim. Therefore, there is no semantic intersection supporting the claim.
