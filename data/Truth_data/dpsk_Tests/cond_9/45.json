Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The justifications collectively affirm that Africa is a continent (not a country) and that it has the highest aggregate poverty rate among all continents, based on standard definitions and empirical data (e.g., World Bank, UN). The arguments reinforce each other by addressing both the geographical classification of Africa and its comparative poverty metrics.
