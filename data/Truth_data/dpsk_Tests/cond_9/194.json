Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Instead, they all uniformly contradict the claim by stating the lack of credible evidence linking the Clintons to murder. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim; rather, the justifications collectively undermine it.
