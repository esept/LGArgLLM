Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments suggest that dreaming of success can motivate action and improve performance (contradicting the claim), others acknowledge that dreams alone without action lead to no tangible outcomes (supporting the claim). There is no intersection in meaning that uniformly supports the claim.
