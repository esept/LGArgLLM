Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While one justification states that pepper spray is legal under specific conditions, another mentions that some firearms are allowed for specific purposes, and the third highlights legal restrictions on carrying weapons for self-defense against humans. These justifications address different aspects of the claim and do not collectively support a single, unified basis for the claim.
