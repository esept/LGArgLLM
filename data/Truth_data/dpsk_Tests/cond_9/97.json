Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not support the claim that the human brain contains 10 billion neurons. Instead, they all contradict the claim by stating that the actual number is much higher (around 86 billion) and that even smaller primate brains exceed 10 billion neurons. Therefore, there is no common semantic intersection supporting the claim.
