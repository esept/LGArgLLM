Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Instead, they collectively contradict the claim by providing evidence that the Dutch are taller on average than Americans. The arguments cite global height studies, nutrition and healthcare systems, genetic factors, historical data, and public health policies, all of which support the opposite of the claim.
