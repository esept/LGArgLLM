Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not support the claim that people drink less coffee in the US than in Mexico. Instead, they argue the opposite, stating that the US has higher per capita coffee consumption, a more ingrained coffee culture, and greater overall consumption compared to Mexico. There is no common semantic core supporting the claim; rather, the arguments contradict it.
