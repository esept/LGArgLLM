Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core: modern brain imaging technology (e.g., fMRI, PET scans) and neuroscientific research have not found empirical evidence supporting the left-brain/right-brain dominance theory. Each justification reinforces this by citing specific findings (e.g., lack of hemispheric dominance correlation, involvement of both hemispheres in cognition) or institutional rejections (e.g., APA) based on neuroimaging evidence. Thus, they collectively support the claim's refutation of the left-brain/right-brain distinction.
