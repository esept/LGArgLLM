Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments highlight factors like lake-effect snow and Barrie's geography to support higher snowfall in Barrie, while others mention Montreal's colder temperatures and continental weather patterns to suggest Montreal could have more snowfall. These justifications present conflicting reasons rather than a unified basis for the claim.
