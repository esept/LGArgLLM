Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by providing evidence of the moon landings' authenticity (e.g., implausibility of large-scale conspiracy, third-party verification, and technological artifacts). There is no intersection of justifications that supports the claim that the moon landings were faked.
