Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that consistently achieving returns significantly above the market average (e.g., 15% vs. 10%) over a long period (ten years) demonstrates superior investment skill, strategy, and risk management, which are hallmarks of a great investor. Each argument reinforces this core idea from slightly different angles (e.g., benchmark comparison, rarity, reduced luck, financial literature consensus).
