Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that challenges the attribution of skill to an investor's consistent high returns by highlighting the role of survivorship bias, random chance, and the rarity of persistent outperformance in financial markets. Each justification supports the claim by providing different but complementary reasons why high returns alone are insufficient to conclude skill.
