Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. While some arguments highlight similarities (e.g., both are national holidays with patriotic displays), others emphasize differences (e.g., federal vs. regional status, historical significance). The lack of a consistent intersection in meaning across all justifications means there is no unified semantic basis for the claim.
