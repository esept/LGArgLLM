Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments suggest an increase in working hours (e.g., due to the gig economy, remote work, or technological advancements), while others indicate stability or limitations (e.g., labor laws, stable data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The justifications are contradictory and do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
