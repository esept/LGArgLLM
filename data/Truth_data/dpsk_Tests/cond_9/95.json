Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification emphasizes that cage-free hens have the freedom to move and access outdoor areas, often due to agricultural standards, consumer demand, welfare studies, or certification requirements. This consistent focus on outdoor access and roaming freedom forms a shared basis for the claim.
