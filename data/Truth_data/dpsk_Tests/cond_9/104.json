Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by pointing out the lack of credible evidence linking Area 51 to secret societies, emphasizing its known role in military research, and dismissing such claims as conspiracy theories. There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim.
