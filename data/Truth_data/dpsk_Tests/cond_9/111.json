Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Each justification addresses a different aspect of the claim (immigrant population, chicken consumption, pork consumption, statistical data, and market norms) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, there is no single semantic intersection that supports the claim as a whole.
