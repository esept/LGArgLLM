Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that no existing machine or technology has been scientifically validated or demonstrated to detect all forms of lying with perfect accuracy and reliability. The justifications consistently highlight limitations such as lack of scientific validation, unreliability due to individual differences, and the absence of peer-reviewed proof of universal lie detection. This shared basis supports the claim.
