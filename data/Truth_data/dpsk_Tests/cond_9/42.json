Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of all P-type arguments consistently indicate that Nixon's statement "I am not a crook" was made in the context of the Watergate scandal and political misconduct, not his personal finances. There is no overlap or intersection in the justifications supporting the claim that Nixon was referring to his personal finances. Instead, they uniformly contradict the claim.
