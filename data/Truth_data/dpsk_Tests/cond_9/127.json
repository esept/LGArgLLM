Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument casts doubt on the claim by pointing to failed replications, while the second and third arguments support the idea that body posture can influence mental states, either through specific findings (second argument) or broader research (third argument). There is no intersection in meaning that collectively supports the claim.
