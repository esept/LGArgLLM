Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments (e.g., Gini coefficient, median household income) suggest the US has less income inequality, while others (e.g., progressive tax system, universal healthcare, labor unions) imply Canada has less income inequality. The justifications contradict rather than support a unified basis for the claim.
