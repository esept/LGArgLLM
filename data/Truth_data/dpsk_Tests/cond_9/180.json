Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively refute the claim by stating that scientific studies and authoritative bodies have not found conclusive evidence linking MSG to migraines in small doses. There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim's assertion of harm.
