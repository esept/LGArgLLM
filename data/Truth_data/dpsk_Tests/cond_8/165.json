Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share common themes related to affordability (e.g., increased income, technological advancements, global trade, and retail competition), not all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about government policies and subsidies does not directly overlap with the argument about the rise of supermarkets and retail chains, as they address different mechanisms (policy vs. market competition) for achieving affordability. Thus, not all pairs share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
