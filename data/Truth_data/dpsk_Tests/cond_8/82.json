Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. The first and second arguments both discuss the concept of ego depletion and its relation to self-control and cognitive fatigue. The first and third arguments both reference Baumeister's experiments and their impact on psychological theories. The second and third arguments both connect ego depletion to broader psychological theories and understanding. Thus, every pair has at least one common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications supporting the claim.
