Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The arguments consistently reference West Virginia's high obesity rates, supported by CDC data, consistent reporting, national health surveys, and public health policies. These justifications collectively reinforce the claim that no state is significantly more obese than West Virginia.
