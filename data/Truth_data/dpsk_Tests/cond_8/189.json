Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first and second arguments both discuss the role of survivorship bias in distorting the perception of skill, while the second and third arguments both address the statistical or academic perspective on the rarity of persistent outperformance. The first and third arguments both touch on the difficulty of attributing success solely to skill. Thus, every pair of arguments has at least one common idea or reasoning pattern in their justification that supports the claim.
