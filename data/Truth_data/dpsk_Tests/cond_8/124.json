Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that swallowing gum is harmless because it passes through the digestive system without causing harm or being absorbed. Each justification reinforces this central point, whether by stating gum's indigestibility, its excretion in feces, medical consensus, debunking myths, or noting the lack of blockage unless consumed in extreme quantities. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
