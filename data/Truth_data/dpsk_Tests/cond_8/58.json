Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The first argument cites specific countries with higher wages, the second discusses income inequality in the U.S., and the third mentions net disposable income differences. The common theme is comparing earnings between Americans and people in other countries, with each argument providing a different angle (gross wages, income distribution, net income after taxes and benefits).
