Result: false
Justification: While all arguments support the claim about Donald Sutherland, they do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about his distinctive looks and decades of fame does not semantically overlap with the argument about his three marriages and five children. Similarly, his online presence and political views are distinct from his personal life details and career achievements. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
