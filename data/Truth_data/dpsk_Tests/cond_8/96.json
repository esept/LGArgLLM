Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim. The first two arguments discuss restrictions on who can legally carry a gun (felons, mentally ill, background checks), which contradicts the claim that "anyone" can carry a gun legally. The third argument discusses the constitutional right to bear arms, which is a different point altogether. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
