Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the rarity and lack of documentation of photographic memory, the second on the role of trained mnemonic techniques, and the third on the prevalence rates being far lower than 1 in 10,000. These are distinct points without semantic overlap.
