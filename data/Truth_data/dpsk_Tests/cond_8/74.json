Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly compares the number of international arrivals between Bangkok and Paris, cites data or rankings supporting Bangkok's higher numbers, or explains reasons (e.g., strategic location, lower costs, role as a hub) for Bangkok's higher arrivals. These common themes ensure semantic intersection across all pairs.
