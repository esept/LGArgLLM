Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that Bargh's study did not establish a psychological law due to its failure to replicate. The first argument explicitly mentions the failure to replicate in subsequent experiments, while the second argument emphasizes the general scientific requirement of replication, which Bargh's study lacks. Thus, their justifications overlap in relation to the claim.
