Result: false
Justification: The arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. All arguments focus on debunking the myth that porcupines can actively fire their quills, emphasizing that quills detach only upon contact, lack anatomical mechanisms for ejection, and that the misconception arises from passive defense behavior. Thus, all pairs of arguments share common reasoning patterns supporting the claim's falsity.
