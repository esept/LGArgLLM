Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument either references the thermodynamic principles of heat application leading to boiling, empirical observations of water boiling under heat, or the predictable physical process of phase transition. These ideas are interconnected and support the claim in a consistent manner.
