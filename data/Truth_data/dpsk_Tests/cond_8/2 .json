Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides evidence (historical records, fall of the empire, archaeological evidence) that the Aztec civilization existed much more recently than "thousands of years ago," with a focus on specific timeframes (15th-16th centuries, 1521, 14th century). The common idea is that the Aztec civilization was not ancient by the standard of "thousands of years ago."
