Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the taxonomic classification of toads within the broader category of frogs, either by mentioning the order Anura, the family Bufonidae, or the scientific consensus that toads are a specialized group of frogs. This common theme ensures that every pair of arguments intersects semantically in supporting the claim.
