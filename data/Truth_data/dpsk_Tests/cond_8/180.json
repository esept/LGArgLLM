Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not overlap semantically in a way that supports the claim. Instead, they all independently refute the claim by citing different authoritative sources (FDA, EFSA, American Migraine Foundation) and studies (double-blind, placebo-controlled) that conclude MSG is not harmful in small doses and does not cause migraines. There is no shared proposition or reasoning pattern in the justifications that supports the claim; rather, they all contradict it.
