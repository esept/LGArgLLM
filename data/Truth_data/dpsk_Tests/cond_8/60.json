Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either discusses the biological limitations of birds (vocal apparatus, cognitive structures), the lack of evidence for bird fluency, or the distinction between mimicry and true linguistic understanding. These themes are interconnected and collectively support the claim that no birds have ever become fluent in English.
