Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to the lack of direct historical evidence, the late emergence of the story, or the official credit given to Francis Hopkinson, all of which support the claim that the Betsy Ross story is likely apocryphal. The common themes include the absence of contemporaneous records, the 19th-century origin of the story, and alternative historical accounts.
