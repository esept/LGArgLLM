Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses the treatability of skin cancer, the second focuses on chronic conditions like heart disease or Alzheimer's, and the third compares skin cancer deaths to other types of cancer deaths. There is no semantic overlap in their justifications.
