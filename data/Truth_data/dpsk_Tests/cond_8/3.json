Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly references the architectural function of vomitoriums as entrances in Roman stadiums or clarifies the misconception about their purpose. The common themes include the definition of vomitoriums, their historical and archaeological evidence, and the correction of modern misinterpretations, all of which support the claim about their use as stadium entrances.
