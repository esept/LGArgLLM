Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. The first and third arguments both discuss Dirac's Nobel Prize in Physics and his contributions to quantum mechanics. The second argument, while focusing on Dirac's birthplace, still connects to the claim by establishing his British origin, which is part of the claim. The third argument reinforces the first by providing additional context about the Nobel Prize's criteria, which aligns with Dirac's achievements mentioned in the first argument. Thus, all pairs overlap in supporting the claim.
