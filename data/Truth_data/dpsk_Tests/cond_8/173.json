Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the historical lack of a definitive attributed composer for the melody, while the second argument discusses the general nature of folk melodies entering the public domain without recorded composers. These are distinct points without a common idea or reasoning pattern.
