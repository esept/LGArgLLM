Result: false
Justification: The first and second arguments have opposing justifications (one casts doubt on the claim, the other supports it), and the third argument introduces a broader concept (embodied cognition) that is not directly overlapping with the justifications of the first two arguments. Therefore, not all pairs share semantic intersections in their justifications.
