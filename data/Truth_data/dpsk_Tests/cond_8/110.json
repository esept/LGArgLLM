Result: false
Justification: 
- A1 and A2 both discuss factors leading to increased working hours (studies showing increased workweek and gig economy effects), so they overlap.
- A3 and A5 both reference labor laws/regulations and data showing stability or limits on working hours, so they overlap.
- However, A1/A2 (supporting the claim) do not share semantic overlap with A3/A5 (opposing the claim) in their justifications. For example, A1's focus on empirical studies does not intersect with A3's focus on labor laws.
- Similarly, A4 (technological advancements) and A6 (decline of unionization) do not share semantic overlap with each other or with some of the other arguments (e.g., A4 does not overlap with A3 or A5).
Thus, not all pairs share semantic intersections in their justifications.
