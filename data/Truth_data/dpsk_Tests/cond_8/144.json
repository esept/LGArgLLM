Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not support the claim that "Our planet is the only one in the universe that can support life." Instead, they argue against it by presenting evidence and reasoning that suggest the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe. For example, the first argument mentions the statistical likelihood of other planets supporting life, the second points to the discovery of exoplanets in habitable zones, and the third discusses extremophiles on Earth as evidence that life could exist in harsh conditions elsewhere. These justifications do not overlap in supporting the given claim; rather, they collectively contradict it. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share semantic intersections that support the claim.
