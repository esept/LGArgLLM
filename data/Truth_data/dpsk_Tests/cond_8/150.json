Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim. For example, all arguments mention factors related to the prevalence or incidence of breast cancer compared to lung cancer (e.g., higher incidence rate, broader age range, genetic and lifestyle factors). Additionally, several arguments reference the impact of public health measures or medical advances on lung cancer rates, which indirectly supports the claim by contrasting the situation with breast cancer. These overlapping themes ensure that every pair of arguments has a semantic intersection in their justifications.
