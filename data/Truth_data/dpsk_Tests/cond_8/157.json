Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first two arguments focus on the positive motivational effects of dreaming about future success, while the third argument introduces a contrasting idea about the short-lived nature of motivation without actionable planning. The fourth argument discusses mental rehearsal, which is related but not overlapping with the other justifications. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
