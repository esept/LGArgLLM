Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the biological processes (genetics and hormones) that cause baldness, while the second argument discusses medical treatments (minoxidil or finasteride) as targeting the root causes of baldness. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
