Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the negative consequences of prematurely assuming outcomes (e.g., overconfidence, poor planning, financial/emotional setbacks, diverted attention, wasted effort, unrealistic optimism). These ideas are interconnected and collectively support the claim about the risks of counting chickens before they hatch.
