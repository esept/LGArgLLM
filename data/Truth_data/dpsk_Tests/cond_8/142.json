Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share any overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument simply states that Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, while the second argument provides additional details about the specific contributions for which the prize was awarded. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
