Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Canada's legal, institutional, and cultural frameworks strongly protect freedom of expression, making book bans rare. Each justification reinforces this overarching theme, whether through references to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the high legal threshold for bans, the role of public institutions, the lack of centralized censorship, historical records, or court precedents. The semantic overlap is clear and consistent across all pairs of arguments.
