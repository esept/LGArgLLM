Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. The first argument cites inflation-adjusted data from Statistics Canada, the second mentions global factors like climate change and supply chain disruptions, and the third refers to government reports and economic analyses. While all arguments support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping justifications.
