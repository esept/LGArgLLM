Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the failure of Bem's study to replicate and the lack of robust evidence for precognition. They all contribute to the claim by emphasizing different aspects of the replication failure (e.g., methodological flaws, statistical artifacts, scientific consensus, meta-analyses), but none are disjoint in meaning with respect to the claim.
