Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic theme—the lack of scientific evidence or recognition for cryptids—and thus none are disjoint. Each argument reinforces the claim by highlighting different aspects of the absence of proof (e.g., definition, consensus, documentation, evidence, institutional rejection, or disciplinary legitimacy), but all are semantically related.
