Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason for the increase in lung cancer rates among American men (historical data on cigarette smoking, occupational exposures to carcinogens, the impact of anti-smoking campaigns, and statistical analyses of cancer registries). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
