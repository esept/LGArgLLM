Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the physiological necessity for tiger sharks to swim continuously for oxygen uptake, either through direct explanation (obligate ram ventilation, gill structure) or indirect evidence (observations, scientific studies). None of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
