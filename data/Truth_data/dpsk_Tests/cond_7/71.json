Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint as they all share a common theme supporting the claim that fortune cookies originated in California, not China. Each justification provides a different angle (historical records, popularization, absence in traditional Chinese cuisine, production techniques, and early documentation) but all contribute to the same overarching point. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
