Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., lack of verifiable evidence, historical transparency, scientific consensus, anecdotal evidence, independent investigations) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
