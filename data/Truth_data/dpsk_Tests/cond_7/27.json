Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument discusses the treatability of skin cancer, the second focuses on the higher likelihood of death from chronic conditions in older women, and the third compares skin cancer deaths to other cancer types. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports or opposes the claim.
