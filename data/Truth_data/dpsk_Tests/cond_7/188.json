Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common semantic subset: they reference neuroscientific research, brain imaging studies, or authoritative organizations to support the claim that left-brain/right-brain dominance lacks empirical evidence. For example, arguments mentioning fMRI/PET scans, meta-analyses, and the American Psychological Association all converge on the same core idea refuting hemispheric dominance.
