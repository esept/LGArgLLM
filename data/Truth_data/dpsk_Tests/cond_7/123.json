Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all argue against the claim by providing evidence of the Beatles' legality in the UK through cultural celebration, absence of prohibitive laws, recognition by official bodies, and availability in major retailers. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
