Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic theme that the Aztec civilization existed much more recently than "thousands of years ago," each providing different types of evidence (historical records, the fall date, and archaeological evidence). Since none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false. However, the task asks to return True if at least one pair is disjoint, which is not the case here. Therefore, the correct result is False, but based on the given instructions, we return True if at least one pair is disjoint, which is not satisfied here. Given the phrasing of the task, the correct output should be:

```
Result: false
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all provide evidence that the Aztec civilization existed more recently than "thousands of years ago."
