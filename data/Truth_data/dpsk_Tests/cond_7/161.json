Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss traits (charm and social grace vs. diplomatic and fair-minded) that contribute to Libras being perceived as charming and smart. The third argument provides examples that reinforce the same traits mentioned in the first two arguments. Thus, none of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
