Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are related to the claim that cage-free hens can roam outdoors and have access to the outdoors. They all discuss aspects such as freedom to move, agricultural standards, consumer demand, animal welfare studies, farm practices, and certification programs, which collectively support the claim. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
