Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument discusses cyclical trends in gold prices, while the second focuses on gold as a hedge against inflation. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
