Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic theme related to Baumeister's ego depletion experiments and their implications for executive function and self-control. Specifically, they all discuss aspects of ego depletion, cognitive fatigue, and the broader psychological impact of Baumeister's work, indicating overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
