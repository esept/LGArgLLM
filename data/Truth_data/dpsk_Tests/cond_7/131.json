Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic theme related to gun ownership rates in the U.S. and Australia, supported by statistical data and legal/cultural contexts. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to disproving the claim by reinforcing the same underlying points about comparative gun ownership rates.
