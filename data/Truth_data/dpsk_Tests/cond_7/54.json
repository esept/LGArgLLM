Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification discusses ethical constraints preventing harmful actions, the second focuses on user authentication and authorization, and the third mentions narrow AI systems like voice assistants that follow commands without ethical evaluation. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim.
