Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both mention the diversity of languages spoken by Hispanics, including Spanish and indigenous languages. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both discuss the cultural and historical reasons for linguistic diversity among Hispanics. Since there is overlap in the semantic content of the justifications, the result is true.
