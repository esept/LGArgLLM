Result: true
Justification: Each argument presents a distinct justification highlighting different languages or linguistic contexts among Jewish communities (Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino, dominant host country languages, modern Israel's linguistic diversity, historical communities' languages). None of the justifications share a common semantic subset that overlaps in supporting the claim; each introduces a unique aspect of linguistic diversity among Jews.
