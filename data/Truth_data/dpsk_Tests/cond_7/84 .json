Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim, such as its ranking on the AFI list, critical acclaim, cultural impact, AFI's ranking methodology, and its combination of artistic achievement and societal influence. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps with another in supporting the claim.
