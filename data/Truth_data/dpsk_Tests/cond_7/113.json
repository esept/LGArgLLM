Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are semantically related to the claim and overlap in meaning. Each justification supports the claim by providing historical context, direct evidence, or widely accepted interpretations that Nixon's statement "I am not a crook" was in reference to the Watergate scandal. There are no pairs of justifications that are disjoint with respect to the claim.
