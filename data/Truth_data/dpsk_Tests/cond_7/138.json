Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, the arguments about Chicago's population size, economic importance, and demographic diversity all contribute to the idea that Chicago is "our biggest and most diverse city." Similarly, the arguments about tourism and expensive rents support the claim's description of Chicago as an "economic hub with lots of tourists and very expensive rents." Since the justifications share common semantic subsets that support the claim, none of the pairs are disjoint.
