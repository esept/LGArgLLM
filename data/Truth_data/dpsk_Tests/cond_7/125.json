Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites a specific randomized controlled trial (PROBIT study) showing no significant IQ differences, while the second argument references the American Academy of Pediatrics' stance on breastfeeding benefits without substantial intelligence gains. These justifications rely on different sources and types of evidence, so they do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
