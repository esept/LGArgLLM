Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe. For example, the arguments about exoplanets in habitable zones and the principle of mediocrity both imply that Earth is not unique in its ability to support life. Similarly, the arguments about extremophiles and organic molecules both suggest that life could exist in conditions similar to or different from Earth's. Therefore, none of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
