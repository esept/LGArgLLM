Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap in their support of the claim by citing different sources (WHO, OECD, public health studies, national health surveys, and dietary patterns) that all indicate higher obesity rates in Mexico compared to Ireland. However, each justification introduces a distinct aspect (e.g., global ranking, prevalence data, related diseases, survey consistency, dietary causes), making them semantically non-disjoint with respect to the claim.
