Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint as they all share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Each argument provides different evidence (neuroscientific research, modern counting techniques, comparative neuroanatomy) that collectively refutes the claim that the human brain contains 10 billion neurons. Therefore, the justifications overlap in their support of the claim.
