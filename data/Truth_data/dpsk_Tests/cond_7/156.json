Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the hormonal changes (testosterone and cortisol) reported in Cuddy's study, the second argument discusses the broader psychological concept of embodied cognition, and the third argument mentions the practical use of power poses in self-help programs. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
