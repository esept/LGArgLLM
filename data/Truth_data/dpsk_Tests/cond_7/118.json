Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all revolve around the subjectivity and variability of human preferences and cultural diversity, which are overlapping themes supporting the claim. For example, arguments about subjective taste preferences and cultural diversity in food traditions share a common semantic subset related to the lack of universal agreement on desserts.
