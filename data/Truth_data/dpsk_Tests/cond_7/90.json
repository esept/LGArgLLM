Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or piece of evidence (e.g., lake-effect snow, historical data, elevation, urban heat island effect) to support or oppose the claim, without overlapping in meaning. For example, the argument about Barrie's proximity to the Great Lakes does not share semantic content with the argument about Montreal's urban heat island effect.
