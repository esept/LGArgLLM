Let's analyze the justifications of the arguments with respect to the claim.

The claim is about the legality of carrying various weapons (guns, knives, clubs, and pepper spray) in Canada. The three arguments provide justifications that address different aspects of this claim:

1. The first justification discusses the legality of pepper spray, noting it must be labeled as animal repellent.
2. The second justification discusses the legality of non-restricted firearms for specific purposes like hunting.
3. The third justification discusses the prohibition of carrying weapons (like clubs and knives) for self-defense against humans.

These justifications are semantically disjoint because:
- They each address different weapons (pepper spray vs. firearms vs. clubs/knives).
- They each discuss different legal conditions or restrictions (labeling requirements vs. licensing for specific purposes vs. prohibition for self-defense).
- There is no overlap in the semantic content that supports the claim - each justification stands independently regarding a different aspect of weapon legality.

Result: true
Justification: The justifications address different weapons (pepper spray, firearms, clubs/knives) under different legal conditions, with no semantic overlap in their support of the claim.
