Result: false
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to the high humidity in Hong Kong, with each justification providing different reasons (climate type, monsoon influence, urban heat island effect) that collectively support the claim. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
