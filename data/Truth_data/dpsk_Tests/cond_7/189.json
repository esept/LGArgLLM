Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification discusses survivorship bias and its effect on perception, the second focuses on statistical analysis and random chance, and the third cites academic research and the efficient market hypothesis. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
