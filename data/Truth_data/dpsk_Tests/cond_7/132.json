Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, the first and third arguments both discuss higher coffee consumption in the US compared to Mexico, albeit from different angles (per capita vs. overall consumption). Similarly, the second and fourth arguments both touch on cultural differences that influence coffee consumption. Since there are overlapping semantic subsets, the justifications are not disjoint.
