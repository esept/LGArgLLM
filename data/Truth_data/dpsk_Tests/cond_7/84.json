Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention AFI's ranking methodology and Schindler's List's critical acclaim, cultural impact, and historical significance. These shared themes mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
