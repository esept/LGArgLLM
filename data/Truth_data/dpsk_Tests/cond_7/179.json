Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the safety of nuclear power (e.g., lower mortality rate, rare severe accidents, minimal air pollution, regulatory oversight, waste storage, and comparative risk assessments). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
