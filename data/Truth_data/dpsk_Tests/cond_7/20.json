Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., raising ALS awareness, long history, iconic stadium, modern training facilities, and World Series championships). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
