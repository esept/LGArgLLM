Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the legal recognition of Islam as the dominant religion and the adherence of citizens to Sunni Islam, while the second argument emphasizes historical records and demographic studies showing Islam as the majority religion for centuries. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
