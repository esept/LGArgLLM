Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by discussing different limitations or failures of lie-detection machines, such as lack of scientific validation, reliance on unreliable cues, inability to detect lies perfectly, failure to distinguish stress from deception, lack of universal technology, and legal non-acceptance. These points overlap in their contribution to supporting the claim that no machine can rigorously detect all kinds of lies.
