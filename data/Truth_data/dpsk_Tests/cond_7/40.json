Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the lack of a causal relationship between physical appearance (hair length) and intelligence, while the second argument highlights the variability of cultural norms around hair length, which makes it an unreliable indicator. These points do not overlap in meaning.
