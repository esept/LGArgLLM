Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim about the Roswell incident involving a balloon, but none of the S-type arguments' justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type justifications. Additionally, the S-type arguments introduce elements (unusual symbols, durable materials, rapid retrieval) that are not addressed or contained within the P-type justifications, indicating a lack of complete semantic coverage for all minimal bases of the claim.
