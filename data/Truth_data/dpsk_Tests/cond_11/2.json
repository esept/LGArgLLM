Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments provide justifications that directly contradict the claim by presenting historical and archaeological evidence that the Aztec Empire existed much more recently than "thousands of years ago." The S-type arguments support these P-type arguments by providing specific dates and comparisons that reinforce the recency of the Aztec Empire, making their justifications semantic subsets of the P arguments' justifications. Thus, for every minimal semantic basis of the claim, there exists at least one P-type argument whose justification contains that basis.
