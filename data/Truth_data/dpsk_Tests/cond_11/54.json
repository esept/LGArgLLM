Result: false  
Justification: The claim states that AI must follow any instruction given by a human, but the P-type arguments provide justifications that contradict this by highlighting ethical constraints, user authentication, and narrow AI behavior. The S-type arguments further support these constraints with legal frameworks, alignment goals, and safeguards. None of the P-type arguments' justifications contain a semantic subset that supports the claim unconditionally; instead, they all introduce conditions or exceptions to following instructions. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
