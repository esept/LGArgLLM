Result: false  
Justification: The claim is that people in England spend more time working now than in the past. The P-type arguments provide reasons why people might be working more now (e.g., technological advancements, gig economy, economic pressures), but none of their justifications contain the semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, which compare historical working hours to modern ones. Specifically, the S-type arguments provide historical context (industrial revolution-era working hours and flexible working arrangements) that directly compare past and present working hours, but these are not subsets of any P-type argument's justification. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
