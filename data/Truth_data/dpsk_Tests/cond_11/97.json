Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification includes semantic subsets that are supported by the S-type arguments. For example, the S-type argument about the cerebellum alone containing 69 billion neurons supports the P-type argument about modern counting techniques showing counts far exceeding 10 billion. Similarly, the S-type argument about early estimates being lower supports the P-type argument about the widely accepted estimate being higher. Thus, every minimal semantic basis of the claim is covered by at least one P-type argument's justification.
