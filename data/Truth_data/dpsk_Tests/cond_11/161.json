Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim by associating Libras with charm and intelligence through astrological and anecdotal evidence. However, the S-type arguments challenge the claim by pointing out the lack of scientific evidence and the influence of other factors like genetics and environment. None of the S-type arguments' justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications; instead, they contradict or undermine the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
