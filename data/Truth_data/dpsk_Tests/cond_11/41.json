Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that suggest no significant impact on attendance due to video recordings, focusing on student preferences and supplement usage. However, the S-type arguments present evidence of potential declines in attendance under certain conditions, which are not fully addressed or contradicted by the P-type justifications. Thus, not all minimal semantic bases of the claim (i.e., potential negative impacts on attendance) are covered by the P-type arguments.
