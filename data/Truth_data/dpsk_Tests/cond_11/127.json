Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains semantic subsets that align with the S-type arguments, providing minimal semantic support for the claim. For example, the first P-type argument about replication failures aligns with the S-type argument about meta-analyses showing small effect sizes. The second P-type argument about original findings aligns with the S-type argument about context-dependent effects. The third P-type argument about embodied cognition aligns with the S-type argument about placebo effects. Thus, for every minimal semantic basis of the claim, there exists a P-type argument whose justification contains that basis.
