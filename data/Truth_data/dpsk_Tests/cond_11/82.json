Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide evidence both for and against the claim, but none of their justifications fully encompass the minimal semantic support sets provided by the S-type arguments. Specifically, the S-type arguments introduce alternative explanations (motivational shifts, attention changes) and the lack of a physiological mechanism, which are not addressed or contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
