Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments' justifications encompass the semantic content of the S-type arguments. For example, the first P-type argument states that intelligence is not determined by physical appearance, which includes the S-type argument about the lack of scientific evidence correlating hair length with intelligence. Similarly, the second P-type argument about cultural norms being unreliable indicators covers the S-type arguments about intelligence being a complex trait and historical examples of intelligent women with varying hair lengths. Thus, for every minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, there exists a P-type argument whose justification contains that basis.
