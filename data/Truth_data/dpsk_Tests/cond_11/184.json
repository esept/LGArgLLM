Result: false  
Justification: The claim states that archaeologists spend most of their time excavating historical sites. The P-type arguments provide justifications that support this claim by emphasizing the importance and time-consuming nature of excavation. However, the S-type arguments contradict the claim by highlighting other significant activities (lab work, surveys, teaching, etc.) that take up more time than excavation. Since the S-type arguments provide minimal semantic support sets that oppose the claim, C11 is not satisfied. There is no P-type argument whose justification contains a basis that aligns with the S-type arguments supporting the claim.
