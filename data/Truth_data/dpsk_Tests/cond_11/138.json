Result: true  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide minimal semantic support sets that are subsets of the justifications in the P-type arguments. For example, the S-type argument "Chicago is not in New Zealand, so it cannot be described by Kiwis (New Zealanders) as 'our biggest and most diverse city'." is a subset of the P-type argument "The term 'Kiwis' refers to people from New Zealand, and Chicago is located in the United States, making it geographically unrelated to New Zealand." Similarly, the other S-type argument aligns with the P-type arguments regarding the geographic and demographic inaccuracies. Thus, C11 is satisfied.
