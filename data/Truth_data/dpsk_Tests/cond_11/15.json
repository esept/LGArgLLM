Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide reasons why the claim is unlikely (e.g., rarity of eidetic memory, prevalence of mnemonic techniques, lack of documentation in adults), but none of their justifications fully contain or semantically subsume the S-type arguments' justifications. The S-type arguments focus on the lack of empirical support and neurological evidence, which are not explicitly covered by the P-type justifications. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
