Result: true  
Justification: All the P-type arguments provide justifications that include the minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments. Specifically, the S-type arguments state that porcupines do not fire quills but rely on passive defense, which is a subset of the justifications in the P-type arguments (e.g., quills detach only upon contact, lack of anatomical mechanisms for ejection, and the passive nature of their defense). Thus, every minimal semantic basis of the claim is covered by at least one P-type argument.
