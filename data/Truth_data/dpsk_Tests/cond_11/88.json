Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide historical data and reasons for a decline in working hours, but the S-type arguments introduce counterpoints (e.g., underemployment and long working hours in certain sectors) that contradict the claim of a consistent decline. These counterpoints are not subsets of the P-type justifications and challenge the claim directly, indicating that not all minimal semantic bases of the claim are supported by the P-type arguments.
