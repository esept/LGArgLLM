Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications contain the minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, which directly state that heart disease, lung cancer, and breast cancer cause more deaths in women than skin cancer. The P-type arguments discuss the treatability of skin cancer, demographic trends, and comparative statistics but do not encompass the specific data points provided by the S-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
