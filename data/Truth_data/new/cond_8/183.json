Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the U.S. tax system uses marginal tax rates, ensuring that only the portion of income within a higher bracket is taxed at that rate. This core idea is present in every argument, either explicitly or implicitly, and supports the claim that take-home earnings will still increase overall despite moving to a higher tax bracket.
