Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about the U.S. having a larger population does not overlap in meaning with the argument about higher taxes on alcohol in Europe. While both support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping reasoning.
