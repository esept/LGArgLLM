Justification: The argument about Friedrich Hayek winning the Nobel Prize does not share any semantic overlap with the other arguments, as it is unrelated to the claim about lawyers and false evidence. The other arguments all relate to legal ethics, perjury laws, or professional conduct, which are directly relevant to the claim.
