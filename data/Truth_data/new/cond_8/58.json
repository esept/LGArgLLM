Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument provides a specific example or reasoning (e.g., median income, social welfare systems, income inequality, oil revenues, minimum wage) that supports the idea that Americans earn less than people in certain countries. The common theme across all justifications is the comparison of U.S. earnings to those in other nations, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
