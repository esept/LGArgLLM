Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided in the arguments do not all relate to the claim about Amy Cuddy's power poses. Many of the arguments discuss unrelated topics such as dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and other scientific phenomena, which do not share any semantic overlap with the claim about power poses. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
