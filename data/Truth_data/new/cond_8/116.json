Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to the absence of evidence or scientific basis for the existence of dragons, whether through empirical evidence, biological science, historical accounts, modern technology, or physical impossibility. These justifications collectively reinforce the claim that dragons do not exist by addressing different aspects of the same underlying reasoning.
