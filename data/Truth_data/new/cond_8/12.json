Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses how geographical and climatic factors (maritime vs. continental climate, influence of the Gulf Stream, exposure to Arctic air masses, and frequency of extreme winter weather) contribute to Paris having cooler winter temperatures compared to Philadelphia. The justifications consistently reinforce the claim by highlighting different aspects of the same underlying climatic mechanisms.
