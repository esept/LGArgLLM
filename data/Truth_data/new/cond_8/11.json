Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not share any semantic overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim "Americans are taller on average than the Dutch." The arguments discuss unrelated topics such as dreams, working hours, religious demographics, language usage, genetics, and shark physiology, none of which pertain to the average height of Americans or the Dutch. Therefore, there is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
