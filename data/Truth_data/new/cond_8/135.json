Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not relate to the claim about Donald Trump not being selected as Time's Person of the Year. Instead, they discuss unrelated topics such as language teaching, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and other irrelevant subjects. Therefore, there is no semantic overlap in the justifications that supports the claim.
