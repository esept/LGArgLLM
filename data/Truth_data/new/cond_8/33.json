Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that porcupines use their tails with quills as a defense mechanism against predators. Each justification elaborates on different aspects of this mechanism (e.g., quill detachment, tail swinging, barbed quills, passive defense, injuries to predators, control of tail swings), but all are semantically related to the claim about porcupines attacking by swinging their tails into predators.
