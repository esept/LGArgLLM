Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes different aspects of England's legal and cultural framework that collectively support the rarity of book bans. For example, strong legal protections for freedom of expression, substantial justification required for bans, historical overturning of bans, modern prioritization of free speech, public opposition, and cultural emphasis on literary freedom all intersect in their support for the claim that few books are banned in England.
