Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections related to the claim. Each justification discusses aspects of ninja attire, such as practicality, blending in with surroundings, and the inaccuracy of all-black depictions. For example, the idea of blending in is present in arguments about camouflage effectiveness and attire matching local surroundings, while the impracticality of all-black clothing is mentioned in arguments about daylight visibility and theatrical origins. The emphasis on practicality and mobility also overlaps with the focus on disguise and infiltration techniques. Thus, all arguments are interconnected through common themes supporting the claim.
