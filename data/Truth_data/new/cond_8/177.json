Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses aspects of France's legal and societal framework that limit the prohibition of films, such as strong protections for freedom of expression, rare judicial bans, changing societal norms, age ratings over bans, international agreements discouraging censorship, and rare interventions for extreme cases like hate speech. These ideas consistently reinforce the claim that very few films are still illegal to show in France.
