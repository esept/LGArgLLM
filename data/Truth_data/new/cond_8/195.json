Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share common themes (e.g., smoking, environmental factors, and diagnostic improvements), not all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about "longer life expectancy" does not share a common idea with the argument about "improved diagnostic techniques." These two justifications address different aspects of the claim without intersecting in meaning.
