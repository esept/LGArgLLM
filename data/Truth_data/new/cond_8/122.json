Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share common semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the importance of replication in establishing scientific phenomena and the failure of Bem's study to meet this criterion. The overlapping ideas include the necessity of replication, the implications of failed replication, and the resulting lack of validity for Bem's findings.
