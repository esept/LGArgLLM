Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first argument focuses solely on Elon Gasper's attendance at the University of Michigan, while the third argument discusses his chess-playing habits. These justifications do not overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
