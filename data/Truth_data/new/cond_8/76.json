Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses aspects of Obi-Wan Kenobi's decision not to reveal the truth about Anakin Skywalker's fate to Luke, the impact of this omission on Luke, and the significance of Darth Vader's statement in the context of the plot. These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments intersects in meaning with respect to the claim.
