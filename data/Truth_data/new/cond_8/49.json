Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that replicability is a necessary condition for establishing a psychological law. The first argument explicitly states that Bargh's study failed to replicate, while the second argument emphasizes that non-replicable studies cannot establish universal principles or laws. Thus, their justifications overlap in their focus on the importance of replicability in relation to the claim.
