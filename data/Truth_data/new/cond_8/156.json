Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss measurable effects of power poses (feelings of power and confidence vs. hormone level changes). The third argument restates the claim, which is supported by all other arguments. The fourth and fifth arguments both reference psychological theories (self-perception and embodied cognition) that align with the power poses hypothesis. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim through related ideas or evidence.
