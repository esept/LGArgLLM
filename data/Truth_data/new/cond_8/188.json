Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that brain imaging technology (e.g., fMRI, neuroscientific research, meta-analyses) does not support the idea of left-brain or right-brain dominance. Each argument emphasizes that functions are distributed across both hemispheres, refuting the oversimplified dichotomy. The overlap in meaning is clear, as all justifications revolve around the lack of empirical evidence for hemispheric dominance in thinking styles.
