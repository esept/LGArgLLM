Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that cryptids lack verifiable, rigorous scientific evidence (e.g., peer-reviewed studies, empirical data, reproducible proof) to confirm their existence. This core idea is present in every argument's justification, whether discussing the absence of physical evidence, the lack of scientific validation, or the dismissal of cryptozoology as unscientific. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in this central reasoning.
