Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that there are no legal protections or restrictions on killing praying mantises in the U.S., whether at the federal, state, or local level. Each argument reinforces this idea by citing different aspects of the legal framework (e.g., federal laws, Endangered Species Act, state wildlife laws, local ordinances) or the status of praying mantises (e.g., not endangered, beneficial insects). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their core reasoning that killing praying mantises is legally permissible due to the absence of prohibitions.
