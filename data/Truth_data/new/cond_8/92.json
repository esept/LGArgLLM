Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. For example, the ideas of "neat and tidy hairstyles" (A1) and "modern and confident" (A2) both relate to the perception of professionalism. Similarly, "styling and upkeep" (A3) and "cultural norms" (A4) both indirectly support the idea that short hair aligns with professional standards. The argument about "reducing biases related to femininity" (A5) also overlaps with the broader theme of professionalism tied to appearance. Thus, all pairs share at least one common idea supporting the claim.
