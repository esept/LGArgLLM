Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim about Trump knowing the Clintons have murdered people. The arguments cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as language education, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and more, none of which directly support or relate to the claim about Trump and the Clintons. Therefore, there is no common semantic overlap in the justifications that supports the claim.
