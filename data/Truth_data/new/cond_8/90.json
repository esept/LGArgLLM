Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The first, second, and third arguments all discuss factors (location in the snowbelt, historical data, proximity to Great Lakes) that lead to Barrie receiving more snowfall than Montreal. The fourth argument complements these by explaining why Montreal might receive less snowfall (urban heat island effect), which indirectly supports the claim by contrasting with Barrie's conditions. Thus, all pairs of arguments intersect in their support for the claim.
