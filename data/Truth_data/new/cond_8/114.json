Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses how sitting close to the television affects the eyes, either through muscle strain, reduced blinking, increased focusing effort, or exposure to blue light. These justifications all converge on the idea that close proximity to the television causes some form of eyestrain or discomfort.
