Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses stagnating wages and rising food prices, the second focuses on the rising cost of healthy foods, and the third highlights economic inequality. While they emphasize different aspects, all three arguments intersect on the idea that economic factors (wages, prices, inequality) have made food less affordable for certain groups in America, supporting the claim.
