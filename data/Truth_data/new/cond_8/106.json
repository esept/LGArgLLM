Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the genetic relationship between parents and children, specifically highlighting the 50% gene inheritance from parents to children, and contrasts this with the variable (but on average 50%) genetic sharing between siblings. The core idea of direct 50% inheritance from parents versus the probabilistic 50% sharing between siblings is common across all justifications.
