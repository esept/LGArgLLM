Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim about breastfeeding and child intelligence. The arguments listed cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dreams, working hours, religious demographics, language usage, etc.), none of which directly address or overlap with the claim about breastfeeding and intelligence. Therefore, there is no common idea or reasoning pattern shared among the justifications that supports the claim.
