Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic theme that a balanced diet is essential for maintaining health, either by providing essential nutrients, preventing deficiencies, or being supported by scientific consensus and health organizations. Each pair of arguments overlaps in their justification by reinforcing the necessity of a balanced diet for health, albeit through slightly different angles (e.g., nutrient provision, disease prevention, scientific backing). Thus, all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
