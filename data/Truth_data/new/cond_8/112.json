Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that consistently achieving over 15% annual returns for ten years is a strong indicator of superior investment skill, as it significantly outperforms the average market return (S&P 500's ~10%) and demonstrates rare, exceptional performance. Each argument reinforces this core proposition, either by comparing to market averages, emphasizing long-term consistency, or noting the rarity and difficulty of such sustained outperformance.
