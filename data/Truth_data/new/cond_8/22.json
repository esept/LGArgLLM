Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that Cinco de Mayo and July 4th are significant dates associated with national pride and cultural impact in their respective countries or communities. The first argument emphasizes the general recognition of these dates as symbols of national pride, while the second focuses on their cultural impact, particularly in Mexican-American communities. Despite the slight difference in focus, both justifications revolve around the theme of national significance and cultural importance, thus overlapping semantically in relation to the claim.
