Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that "Gestapo's Last Orgy" was banned by British censors due to its explicit, violent, or offensive content, which aligns with the claim. The justifications overlap in their reasoning about the film's violation of UK censorship laws or standards, whether through obscenity, violence, or glorification of war crimes.
