Justification: While all arguments support the claim that smoking is more prevalent in the United States than in Spain, their justifications do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first argument cites prevalence statistics, the second cites consumption data, the third cites cultural attitudes, the fourth cites advertising restrictions, and the fifth cites taxation. These are distinct justifications without semantic overlap in their reasoning.
