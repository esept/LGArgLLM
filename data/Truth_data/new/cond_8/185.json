Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly states or implies that the original US Constitution was written on parchment, supported by historical context, physical evidence, or practical reasons (e.g., durability). The common idea across all justifications is the material (parchment) used for the Constitution, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
