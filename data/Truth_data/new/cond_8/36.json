Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification of the legal concept of entrapment in the U.S., where law enforcement's inducement or facilitation of a crime invalidates prosecution. Each argument either directly references entrapment, cites legal precedents, or mentions constitutional protections against such practices, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
