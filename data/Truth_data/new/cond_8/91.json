Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim about Ulstermen referring to New York City in a specific way. The arguments cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as language teaching, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and more, none of which directly relate to the claim about New York City. Therefore, there is no semantic overlap in the justifications that supports the claim.
