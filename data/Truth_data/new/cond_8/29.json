Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the reasons for the ban, such as perceived immorality, conservative Catholic values, censorship laws, protection of public morality, control of cultural influences, upholding traditional norms, and maintaining public decency. These themes are interconnected and collectively support the claim about the books being banned in Ireland.
