Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not all relate to the claim about survivorship bias and investor skill. Many of the arguments are unrelated to the claim, discussing topics such as language, dreams, and other unrelated subjects. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
