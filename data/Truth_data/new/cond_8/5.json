Result: false
Justification: While many arguments share overlapping justifications (e.g., London's global connectivity, business appeal, and language advantage), not all pairs have a direct semantic intersection. For example, the argument about visa policies does not share a clear overlap with the argument about Paris being primarily a tourist destination. Thus, not all pairs share a common justification.
