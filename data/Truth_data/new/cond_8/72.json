Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument discusses London's maritime climate, the second mentions the Gulf Stream's moderating effect, and the third focuses on the urban heat island effect in New York. These are distinct reasons without semantic overlap.
