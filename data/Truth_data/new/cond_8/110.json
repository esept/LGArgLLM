Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share a common theme of factors contributing to increased working hours (e.g., economic pressures, technological changes), not all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about historical data from labor studies does not share a specific semantic overlap with the argument about the decline of union representation. Each argument introduces a distinct reason or evidence for the claim without necessarily intersecting in their justifications.
