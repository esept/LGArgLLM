Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. For example, the argument about Iceland's land area (103,000 square kilometers) does not overlap semantically with the argument about the majority of Iceland's population identifying as Christian. While both support the claim, they address different aspects (geography vs. religion) without intersecting in their justifications.
