Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either provides evidence supporting the conviction of Bruno Hauptmann (e.g., ransom money, forensic analysis of the ladder, handwriting matching ransom notes) or addresses the lack of credible evidence in alternative theories. The common theme across all arguments is the substantiation of the claim that the case was solved, with some arguments also addressing the existence of alternative theories. Therefore, all pairs of arguments intersect semantically in supporting the claim.
