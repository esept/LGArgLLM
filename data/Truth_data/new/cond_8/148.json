Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the distinction between short-term weather (like a cold day) and long-term climate trends (global warming). The common ideas include the scientific consensus on global warming as a long-term trend, the independence of local weather variations from global trends, and the influence of multiple factors on weather. These shared propositions ensure that every pair of arguments intersects semantically.
