Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the lack of scientific evidence or biological plausibility for curing diseases through touch alone, often referencing the need for specific medical interventions or the limitations of touch in addressing disease mechanisms. For example, arguments about the absence of scientific evidence (A1, A4), biological processes (A2, A3), and the necessity of medical treatments (A1, A5) all intersect in their reasoning. Thus, every pair of arguments has at least one common idea supporting the claim.
