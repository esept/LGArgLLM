Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common semantic justification that there is no definitive evidence or consensus on who designed the first American flag. Each argument highlights different aspects of this lack of consensus, such as the absence of historical records, multiple credited individuals, lack of contemporary documentation, ongoing debates among scholars, and the absence of formal records by the Continental Congress. These justifications all intersect in their core idea that the designer of the first American flag remains uncertain.
