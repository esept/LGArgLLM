Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument highlights different limitations or shortcomings of current lie detection technologies, such as reliance on unreliable physiological responses, significant error rates, inability to replicate complex human processes, lack of scientific consensus, and production of false results. These ideas collectively support the claim that no machine can rigorously detect all kinds of lies, and they intersect in their focus on the inadequacies of existing technologies.
