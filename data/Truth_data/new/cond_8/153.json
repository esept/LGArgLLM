Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the word 'shit' originates from Old English 'scitte' and has Proto-Germanic roots. Each justification either references historical linguistic records, etymological studies, comparative linguistics, authoritative sources like the Oxford English Dictionary, or phonetic and semantic evolution patterns, all of which support the claim about the word's origin. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
