Result: false
Justification: The first argument's justification focuses on the freedom of cage-free hens to move within an enclosed space, while the second argument's justification directly states that cage-free hens can roam outdoors and have access to the outdoors. These justifications do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern in relation to the claim, as one is about indoor movement and the other is about outdoor access.
