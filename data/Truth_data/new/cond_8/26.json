Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either references scientific studies, the composition of pangolin scales, the lack of recognition by modern medicine or health organizations, or the absence of regulatory approval. These ideas are interconnected and collectively support the claim that pangolin scales are not effective medicine.
