Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument highlights different aspects of why rugby is not widely loved in most countries, such as its niche status, physical demands, lack of cultural presence, low popularity rankings, and accessibility issues. These reasons collectively support the claim that in no country do most people love playing rugby, and they intersect in their focus on the limited appeal and reach of rugby globally.
