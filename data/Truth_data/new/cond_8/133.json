Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that Hong Kong's climate or geographical features lead to high humidity. The first argument mentions the subtropical climate, the second highlights the coastal location, and the third refers to the monsoon seasonâ€”all of which are factors contributing to humidity. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in supporting the claim.
