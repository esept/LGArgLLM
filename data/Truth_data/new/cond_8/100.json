Result: false
Justification: While many pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications (e.g., "Official labor statistics" and "Historical data" both reference empirical data on working hours; "Technological advancements" and "Modern workplace cultures" both discuss cultural shifts extending work hours), not all pairs share a direct overlap. For example, "The rise of the gig economy" and "Economic pressures and stagnant wages" address different economic factors (structural changes vs. wage issues) without a clear shared proposition or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
