Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument focuses on the subjectivity and lack of empirical measurability of dreams, the second on the scientific focus on brain activity rather than content interpretation, and the third on the lack of standardized methods for dream interpretation. While all support the claim, their justifications do not overlap semantically.
