Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about the Gini coefficient and the argument about the wage gap between high-skilled and low-skilled workers both measure income inequality but use different metrics. The argument about social welfare programs in Canada introduces a different reasoning pattern (impact of social programs) that is not directly overlapping with the other arguments. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
