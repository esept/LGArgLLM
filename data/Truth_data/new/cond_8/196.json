Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that mirrors do not cause any observable, physical, or supernatural effects when placed by a bed. They all reference the lack of scientific evidence or empirical support for any anomalous outcomes, and they all emphasize the normal functioning of mirrors based on physical laws or common usage. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
