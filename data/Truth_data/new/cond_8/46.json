Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the superstition against mentioning Macbeth in a theater is unfounded, irrelevant, or not universally observed. Each argument reinforces this central idea, either by stating the lack of factual evidence, pointing out the absence of negative consequences, or highlighting the outdated or non-universal nature of the superstition. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their semantic justification with respect to the claim.
