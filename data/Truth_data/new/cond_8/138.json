Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or proposition that supports the claim. For example, arguments about Chicago's size, diversity, economic significance, tourism, and expensive rents all intersect in supporting the claim that Chicago is a large, diverse, economic hub with high rents and many tourists. Each pair of arguments overlaps in at least one of these aspects.
