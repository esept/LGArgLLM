Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly or indirectly references the body's natural detoxification systems (e.g., liver, kidneys) and the lack of scientific evidence or necessity for juice fasts in aiding these processes. The common themes include the inefficacy of juice fasts, the body's inherent detox mechanisms, and the potential harm from nutrient deficiencies caused by juice fasts.
