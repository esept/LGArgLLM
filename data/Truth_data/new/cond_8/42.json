Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dreams, language teaching, economic data, historical events), and their justifications do not share common ideas or reasoning patterns in relation to the claim about Nixon's statement. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications with respect to the claim.
