Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that dreams are subjective, passive, or symbolic experiences that lack the power to directly influence real-world outcomes or guarantee success. Each justification reinforces the claim by emphasizing the disconnection between dreaming/wishing and practical success, whether through the nature of dreams (subjective, subconscious, symbolic) or the requirements for success (active effort, practical actions). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in supporting the claim.
