Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to the claim. For example, technological advancements (A1) and global trade (A2) both contribute to reduced costs, while household income (A3) and inflation-adjusted data (A6) both address affordability in terms of purchasing power. Similarly, government subsidies (A4) and retail competition (A5) both involve systemic factors that lower prices. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in supporting the claim.
