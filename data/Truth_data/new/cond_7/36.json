Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are semantically related to the claim about entrapment and the legal principles preventing prosecution in such cases. They all discuss aspects of entrapment, due process, and legal precedents, meaning there is significant overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint.
