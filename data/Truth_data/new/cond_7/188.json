Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic theme: they all argue against the left-brain/right-brain dominance theory by citing neuroscientific research, functional MRI studies, meta-analyses, or split-brain studies. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, as they all contribute to the same overarching argument that brain imaging technology does not support the distinction between left-brained and right-brained thinkers.
