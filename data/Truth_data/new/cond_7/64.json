Result: true
Justification: The two arguments provided have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the presence of antioxidants in red wine and their potential benefits for cardiovascular health, while the second justification discusses epidemiological correlations without establishing causality. These justifications address different aspects of the claim and do not share a common semantic subset.
