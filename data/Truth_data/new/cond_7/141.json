Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the justification for being a Michigan grad (attending the University of Michigan) does not overlap with the justification for being an avid chess player (public records or personal accounts) or being a genius (demonstrated exceptional intellectual ability). Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim without shared semantic content.
