Let's analyze the justifications of the arguments to determine if any pair is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

Arguments and their justifications:
1. A1: Consistently achieving over 15% annual returns for a decade significantly outperforms the average market return, indicating superior investment skill.
2. A2: The S&P 500's historical average annual return is approximately 10%, so exceeding this by 5% annually for ten years demonstrates exceptional performance.
3. A3: Long-term consistency in high returns suggests the investor has a repeatable and disciplined strategy, a hallmark of great investors.
4. A4: Outperforming the market over a ten-year period is rare and typically achieved only by top-tier investors, supporting the claim.
5. A5: Sustained high returns account for market volatility and economic cycles, proving the investor's ability to adapt and succeed in various conditions.
6. A6: Beating the market consistently for a decade is a widely accepted benchmark for identifying great investors in finance literature.

Now, let's check for semantic disjointness between pairs:

- A1 and A2: Both discuss outperforming average market returns (10% vs 15%), so they overlap.
- A1 and A3: A1 talks about outperforming average returns, A3 about repeatable strategy - different aspects but both relate to greatness.
- A1 and A4: Both discuss outperforming the market - overlap.
- A1 and A5: A1 about outperforming, A5 about adapting to conditions - different but related.
- A1 and A6: Both discuss outperforming the market - overlap.
- A2 and A3: A2 about S&P comparison, A3 about strategy - different but related.
- A2 and A4: Both discuss outperforming the market - overlap.
- A2 and A5: Different aspects but both relate to greatness.
- A2 and A6: Both discuss outperforming the market - overlap.
- A3 and A4: A3 about strategy, A4 about rarity - different but related.
- A3 and A5: Both discuss aspects of investment skill - related.
- A3 and A6: A3 about strategy, A6 about benchmark - different but related.
- A4 and A5: A4 about rarity, A5 about adaptability - different but related.
- A4 and A6: Both discuss outperforming the market - overlap.
- A5 and A6: A5 about adaptability, A6 about benchmark - different but related.

All justifications relate to different aspects of what makes a great investor (performance, strategy, rarity, adaptability, benchmarks), but they all ultimately support the claim through different but interconnected perspectives. There are no pairs whose justifications are completely unrelated to each other with respect to the claim.

```
Result: false
Justification: All argument justifications relate to different but interconnected aspects of what makes a great investor (performance, strategy, rarity, adaptability, benchmarks), with no completely unrelated pairs.
