Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all share a common semantic subset related to the lack of magical or transformative effects when a girl kisses a frog, as well as the absence of scientific or physiological mechanisms that would cause any reaction. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
