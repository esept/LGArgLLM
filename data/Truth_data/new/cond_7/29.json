Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the reasons for the ban, the context of Irish censorship laws, and the societal attitudes at the time. They share common semantic subsets such as the conservative Catholic values, public morality, and the control of cultural influences. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
