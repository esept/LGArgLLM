Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim. For example, "A balanced diet provides all essential nutrients required for bodily functions, supporting overall health" and "Nutritional deficiencies caused by an imbalanced diet can lead to chronic diseases and weakened immunity" both discuss the role of nutrients in health, albeit from positive and negative perspectives. Similarly, "Scientific consensus confirms that varied food intake prevents malnutrition and promotes long-term well-being" and "Major health organizations universally recommend balanced diets as foundational to disease prevention" both reference authoritative support for balanced diets. Thus, no pair of arguments is fully disjoint in their justifications.
