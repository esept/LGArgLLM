Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in meaning as they all provide evidence supporting the claim that Mexico has a higher obesity rate than Ireland. For example, arguments mentioning WHO data, national health surveys, and comparative epidemiological data all refer to statistical comparisons of obesity rates between the two countries. Similarly, arguments about dietary habits and public health policies provide additional supporting reasons that are not disjoint. Since none of the pairs of arguments have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false (i.e., no pair is disjoint).
