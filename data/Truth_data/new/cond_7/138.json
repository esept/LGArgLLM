Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments discuss Chicago's size, diversity, economic significance, and high cost of living, which are all directly related to the claim's description. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
