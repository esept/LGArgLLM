Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as dreams, dietary habits, historical events, and scientific phenomena. There is no common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim "Humans have 10 finger bones" across these arguments. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
