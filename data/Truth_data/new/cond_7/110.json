Let's analyze the justifications of the arguments to determine if any pair is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.

1. Historical data from labor studies show that average weekly working hours in the U.S. have risen since the mid-20th century.
2. The rise of gig economy jobs has led to more Americans working longer or irregular hours to supplement income.
3. Technological advancements, such as smartphones and remote work, have blurred the boundaries between work and personal time, extending work hours.
4. Stagnant wages relative to inflation have forced many Americans to work longer hours to maintain their standard of living.
5. Corporate downsizing and increased productivity demands have resulted in fewer employees handling larger workloads, increasing individual work hours.
6. The decline of union representation has reduced collective bargaining power, making it harder for workers to negotiate shorter work hours.

Now, let's check for semantic overlap between pairs:

- Argument 1 (historical data) is distinct from others as it provides general historical evidence without citing specific causes.
- Arguments 2 (gig economy), 3 (technology), 4 (wages), 5 (corporate downsizing), and 6 (union decline) all cite different specific causes for increased working hours.
- While some arguments might be related in a broader economic context (e.g., wages and union decline), their justifications focus on distinct mechanisms affecting work hours.

All justifications present different reasons or evidence for increased working hours without overlapping in their specific semantic content supporting the claim. Therefore, all pairs are semantically disjoint.

```
Result: true
Justification: All argument pairs present distinct reasons or evidence (historical data, gig economy, technology, wages, corporate demands, union decline) for increased working hours without semantic overlap in their justifications.
