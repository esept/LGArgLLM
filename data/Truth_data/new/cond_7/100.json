Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or evidence supporting the claim (e.g., labor statistics, technological advancements, gig economy, historical data, workplace cultures, economic pressures), and none of them share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in meaning while contributing to the claim.
