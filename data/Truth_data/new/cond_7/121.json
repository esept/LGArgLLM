Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that SOS did not originally stand for anything. They all emphasize the lack of original meaning, the historical context of its adoption, and the reasons for its selection (ease of transmission in Morse code). None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
