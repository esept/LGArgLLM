Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct piece of information (e.g., winning the Nobel Prize, British nationality, Jewish descent, and the awarding institution) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
