Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument discusses Bangkok's tourism, which is irrelevant to the claim about gold prices. The second argument directly addresses the cyclical nature of gold prices, which is relevant. Since there is no overlap in meaning between the justifications, they are disjoint.
