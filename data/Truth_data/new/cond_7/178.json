Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why no machine can rigorously detect all kinds of lies, such as reliance on physiological responses, significant error rates, inability to replicate human deception processes, lack of scientific consensus, and production of false positives/negatives. None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim in the same way.
