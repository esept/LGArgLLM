Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention New York City's diversity and economic significance, which are key points in the claim. Since there is semantic overlap in the justifications, no pair of arguments is completely disjoint with respect to the claim.
