Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the US's larger and more diverse economy, while another discusses Japan's aging population and declining workforce. These justifications address different aspects (US strengths vs. Japan weaknesses) and do not share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim.
