Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to smoking prevalence and cultural/industrial factors in the U.S. and Russia. For example, the first and fourth arguments both reference statistical data on smoking rates, while the second and third arguments discuss cultural and industrial influences. Thus, no pair of arguments is completely disjoint in their justifications with respect to the claim.
