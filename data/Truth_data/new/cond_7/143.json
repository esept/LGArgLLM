Result: true
Justification: The first argument about Friedrich Hayek winning the Nobel Prize is completely unrelated to the claim about lawyers giving false evidence in the U.S. This makes it semantically disjoint with all other arguments, which directly address legal ethics, perjury laws, and professional conduct related to the claim. Therefore, there exists at least one pair of arguments (the Hayek argument paired with any other argument) whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
