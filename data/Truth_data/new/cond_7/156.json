Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference Amy Cuddy's research or experiments (e.g., "Amy Cuddy's research demonstrated..." and "The original power poses experiments showed..."), and others reference broader psychological principles like embodied cognition and self-perception that align with the claim. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
