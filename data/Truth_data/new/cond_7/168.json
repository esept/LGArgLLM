Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic theme that vaccines do not interact with or modify DNA, either by explaining the mechanism (e.g., mRNA not entering the nucleus), citing scientific consensus, or referencing the lack of evidence for DNA modification. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
