Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the maritime vs. continental climate, the second on the Gulf Stream's moderating effect, and the third on the urban heat island effect. Each justification introduces a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
