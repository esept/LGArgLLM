Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the freedom of cage-free hens to move within an enclosed space (a barn), while the second argument directly supports the claim by stating that cage-free hens can roam outdoors. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications regarding the claim.
