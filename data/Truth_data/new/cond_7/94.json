Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics. For example, one argument discusses the dietary habits in Israel, while another talks about the legal status of book bans in Canada. There is no overlap in the semantic content of these justifications with respect to the claim about Columbia University. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint.
