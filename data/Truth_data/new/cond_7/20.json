Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (raising ALS awareness, long history, state-of-the-art training facilities, and recognition as Boston's primary baseball team), with no overlap in their semantic content. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
