Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that Type 1 diabetes is not caused by specific foods. They all emphasize the autoimmune nature of Type 1 diabetes, its distinction from Type 2 diabetes, and the role of genetic/environmental factors rather than diet. No pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
