Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention high mortality rates of skin cancer in women (A1, A2, A4, A5) and public health data or reports supporting the claim (A2, A4). Since there is overlap in meaning, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
