Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (cultural tradition, beef production capacity, agricultural suitability, dietary guidelines, and global ranking) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Since at least one pair of justifications is disjoint, the result is true.
