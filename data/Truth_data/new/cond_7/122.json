Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around the importance of replication in establishing scientific phenomena and the failure of Bem's study to meet this criterion. They share a common semantic subset (replication as a key factor in scientific validity), so no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
