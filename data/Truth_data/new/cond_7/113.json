Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided are related to the context of Nixon's statement "I am not a crook" and its connection to the Watergate scandal. They all share a common semantic subset that supports the claim, as they each provide historical or contextual evidence linking the statement to the scandal. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
