Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dreams, dietary habits, historical events, scientific phenomena). There is no common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim about the meaning of 'AD' in the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
