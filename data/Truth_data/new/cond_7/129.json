Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim about vomitoriums. The arguments and their justifications discuss unrelated topics such as language education, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and other unrelated subjects, none of which overlap or contribute to the support of the claim about ancient Roman vomitoriums. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
