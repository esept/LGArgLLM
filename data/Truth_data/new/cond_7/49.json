Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications emphasize the importance of replicability in establishing psychological laws, with the first focusing on the need for reliable replication across contexts and populations, and the second highlighting that non-replicable studies cannot establish universal principles. These points overlap in their core message about replicability being essential for establishing psychological laws.
