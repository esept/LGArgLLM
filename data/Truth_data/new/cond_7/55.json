Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly diverse and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., language teaching, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, etc.). There is no semantic overlap between the justifications of these arguments with respect to the claim about Princeton University being the South African university described. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint.
