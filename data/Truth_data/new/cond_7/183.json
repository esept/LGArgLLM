Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the marginal tax rates and progressive tax system in the U.S., which ensures that take-home earnings increase despite moving to a higher tax bracket. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
