Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content, as they all emphasize the lack of scientific evidence and biological plausibility for curing diseases through touch alone. For example, arguments about medical science's lack of evidence and the biological nature of healing processes share a common theme. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
