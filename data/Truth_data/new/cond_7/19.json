Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., Gini coefficient, size of the middle class, social welfare programs, poverty rates, labor protections, educational attainment) to support the claim that US incomes are less unequal than those in Brazil. There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications.
