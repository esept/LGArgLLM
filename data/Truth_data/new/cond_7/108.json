Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the claim that tiger sharks can't stop swimming. They all discuss aspects of tiger shark physiology (ram ventilation, lack of buccal pumping, observed behavior, optimized physiology for motion, and obligate ram ventilation) that support the necessity of continuous swimming. Since none of the pairs of arguments have disjoint justifications with respect to the claim, the result is false.
