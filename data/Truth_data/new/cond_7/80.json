Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct reasons (e.g., technological advancements, global competition, economies of scale, inflation-adjusted prices, cheaper manufacturing, consumer demand) that contribute independently to the claim about electronics affordability. There is no overlap in the semantic subsets of their justifications.
