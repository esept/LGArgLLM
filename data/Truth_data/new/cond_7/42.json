Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., linguistics, economics, biology, history, etc.). There is no common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim about Nixon's statement. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
