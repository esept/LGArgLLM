Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as language education, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, genetics, shark physiology, income inequality, and more. There is no semantic overlap between the justifications of these arguments with respect to the claim about coughing mimicking CPR during a heart attack. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint.
