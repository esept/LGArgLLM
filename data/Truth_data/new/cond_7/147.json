Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on inflation-adjusted wages and rising food prices, the second on the relative cost increase of healthy vs. unhealthy foods, and the third on economic inequality and its impact on lower-income households. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
