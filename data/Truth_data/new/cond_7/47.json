Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all support the claim by highlighting different aspects of West Virginia's obesity rates (e.g., CDC rankings, socioeconomic factors, statistical analyses, health policy reports, obesity-related outcomes, and demographic risk factors). While they all converge on the same conclusion, their justifications are semantically distinct and do not share a common subset that directly overlaps in meaning. Thus, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint with respect to the claim.
