Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as dietary habits, historical events, scientific principles, and cultural practices. There is no common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim "Northern Ireland is a part of England" across these justifications. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
