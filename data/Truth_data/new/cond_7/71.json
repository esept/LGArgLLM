Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share the common theme of supporting the claim that fortune cookies originated in California, not China, by providing different pieces of evidence (e.g., mass-production by Japanese immigrants, absence in Chinese culinary tradition, American business development, etc.). However, since the question asks if at least one pair is disjoint, and none of the pairs are disjoint in this case, the correct answer is false. But given the phrasing of the task ("If at least one pair is disjoint, return True. Otherwise, return False."), and since no pair is disjoint, the result is false. However, the initial output was incorrect based on the task's phrasing, so the correct output should be:

```
Result: false
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic subset supporting the claim (e.g., origin in California, absence in China), so no pair is disjoint.
