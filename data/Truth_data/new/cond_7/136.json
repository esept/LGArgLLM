Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the process of water boiling, specifically focusing on the conditions under which boiling occurs (temperature, heat application, and vapor pressure). Since they share a common semantic theme (the physics of boiling water), none of the pairs are disjoint with respect to the claim.
