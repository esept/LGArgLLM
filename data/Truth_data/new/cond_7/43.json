```
Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to legal or systemic reasons (Charter of Rights and Freedoms vs. lack of centralized system) that contribute to the rarity of book bans in Canada. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both mention specific contexts (hate speech/obscenity laws vs. public libraries/schools) where restrictions might occur, but not broad bans. These overlaps indicate shared semantic subsets supporting the claim.
