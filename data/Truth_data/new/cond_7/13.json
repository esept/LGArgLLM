Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are all distinct in their reasoning (dictionary listing, linguistic studies, etymological research, popular usage, and academic/historical sources), and none share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in supporting the claim. Thus, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
