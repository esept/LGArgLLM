Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the safety of nuclear power (e.g., safety measures, statistical data, regulatory standards, modern designs, pollution reduction, historical accidents as outliers). None of the justifications share a common semantic subset that directly overlaps in meaning while contributing to the claim.
