Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss Obi-Wan Kenobi's decision not to reveal the truth about Anakin Skywalker's fate, albeit from slightly different perspectives (accuracy vs. emotional protection). Similarly, the fourth argument overlaps with the second in discussing Obi-Wan's role as a mentor. Therefore, there are semantic overlaps between some pairs of arguments.
