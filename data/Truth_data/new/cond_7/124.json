Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that swallowing gum is harmless. They all revolve around the idea that gum is indigestible, passes through the digestive system without causing harm, and is supported by medical consensus or guidelines. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
