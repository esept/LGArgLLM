Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to UK laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict recording children. They all contribute to the claim by citing different legal frameworks (Data Protection Act 2018, GDPR, safeguarding policies, Protection of Children Act 1978, Human Rights Act 1998) that collectively support the illegality of recording children in the UK. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint.
