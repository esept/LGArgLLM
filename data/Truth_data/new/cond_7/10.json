Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the subjective and non-empirical nature of dreams, the second on the scientific focus on brain activity rather than content interpretation, and the third on the lack of standardized methods for dream interpretation. While all support the claim, they do so from distinct angles without overlapping semantic content.
