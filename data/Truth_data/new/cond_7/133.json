Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. All three arguments share a common semantic theme of explaining why Hong Kong experiences high humidity, either through its subtropical climate, coastal location, or monsoon season. These justifications overlap in their contribution to supporting the claim.
