Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or example supporting the claim that Jews do not all speak one language, without overlapping in meaning. For instance, one argument focuses on Hebrew as a liturgical language, another on dominant languages of different regions, another on Yiddish and Ladino, another on global dispersion, and another on multilingualism. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
