Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct source or mechanism of inspiration (e.g., psychological studies, neuroscience, art history, cognitive science, empirical studies), and none of them overlap in their semantic contribution to supporting the claim.
