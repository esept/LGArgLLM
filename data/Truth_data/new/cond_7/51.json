Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around the lack of definitive evidence, conflicting accounts, and unresolved historical records regarding the designer of the first American flag. They share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all highlight different aspects of the same issue (lack of consensus). Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
