Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in meaning, as they all revolve around the idea that video recordings do not replace the benefits of in-person lectures (e.g., interaction, engagement, social aspects, institutional policies). Thus, no pair of arguments has semantically disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
