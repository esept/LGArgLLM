Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are completely unrelated to the claim about Trump knowing that the Clintons have murdered people. The arguments cover a wide range of topics such as language teaching, dream interpretation, working hours, religious demographics, and more, none of which intersect semantically with the claim. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
