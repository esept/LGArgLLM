Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., historical merger, legal system, parliament, national identity, cultural traditions), and none of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
