Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around Baumeister's experiments and their implications for the concept of ego depletion and executive function. They share a common semantic subset related to the empirical support, theoretical alignment, and broader acceptance of the ego depletion effect. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
