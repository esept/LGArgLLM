Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument focuses on a distinct aspect of the claim (e.g., Iceland's size, religious composition, quality of life), and there is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to supporting the claim.
