Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the body's natural detoxification systems (liver, kidneys) and the lack of scientific evidence supporting juice fasts as effective detox methods. This shared semantic subset means the justifications are not disjoint.
