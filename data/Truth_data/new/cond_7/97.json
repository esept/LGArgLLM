Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly diverse and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dreams, dietary habits, historical events, scientific phenomena). There is no semantic overlap between the justifications of different arguments with respect to the claim about the number of neurons in the human brain. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint.
