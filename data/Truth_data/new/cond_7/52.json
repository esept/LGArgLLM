Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the safety of nuclear power (e.g., lower fatality rates, advanced safety features, minimal air pollution, stable power supply), and none of these reasons overlap in meaning or contribute to the claim in the same way.
