Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in meaning. For example, the first and third arguments both mention that Gerald Edelman and James Watson were born in the United States, and the second argument restates the claim itself, which includes the same information. Therefore, there is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
