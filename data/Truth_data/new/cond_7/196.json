Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, namely that mirrors do not cause any observable or supernatural effects when placed by a bed. Each justification reinforces this idea from slightly different angles (scientific evidence, laws of physics, cultural beliefs, etc.), but none are disjoint in their support of the claim.
