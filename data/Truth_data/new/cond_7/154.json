Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct aspect of the claim (e.g., being a female monarch, interest in archaeology, length of reign, public support, and success of reign) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
