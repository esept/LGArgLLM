Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each address distinct aspects of the claim (classical architecture, modern buildings, law school, urban campus, ranking, and fame) without overlapping in meaning. Each justification supports the claim through a unique facet, ensuring no common semantic subset between any pair.
