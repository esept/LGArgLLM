Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., technological advancements, global trade, household income, government policies, retail competition, inflation-adjusted data) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning. Thus, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
