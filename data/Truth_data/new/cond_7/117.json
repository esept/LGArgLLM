Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct metric or reason (e.g., Gini coefficient, top 1% income share, median household income, wage gap, social welfare programs) to support the claim, and none of these justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset.
