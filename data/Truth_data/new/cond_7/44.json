Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as dietary habits, economic data, historical events, and scientific studies. There is no common semantic subset that connects these justifications to the claim about infrared cameras and ghosts. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
