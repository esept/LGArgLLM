Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., lie detectors, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, dietary habits, etc.). There is no common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim about lie detector tests. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
