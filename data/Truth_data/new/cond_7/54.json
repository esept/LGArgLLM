Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly diverse and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dreams, language teaching, economic data, historical events). There is no common semantic subset that connects these justifications to the claim about artificial intelligences following human instructions. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
