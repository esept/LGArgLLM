Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap in meaning with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention traits like charm, intelligence, and communication skills, which are all related to the claim that Libras are smart and charming. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
