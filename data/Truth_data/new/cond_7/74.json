Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Bangkok's role as a major tourism hub, the second on its affordability compared to Paris, and the third on its function as a gateway to Southeast Asia. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
