Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct aspect of Donald Sutherland's life and career (e.g., his acting career, distinctive looks, marriages and children, online presence, political views, and filmography). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
