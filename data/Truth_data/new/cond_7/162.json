Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., niche popularity, physical demands, cultural/media presence, survey data, infrastructure) that does not overlap with the others in supporting the claim. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
