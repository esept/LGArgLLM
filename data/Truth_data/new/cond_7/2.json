Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided in the arguments are completely unrelated to the claim about the Aztec Empire existing thousands of years ago. The arguments cover a wide range of unrelated topics such as language education, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and more, none of which intersect semantically with the claim about the Aztec Empire. Therefore, the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
