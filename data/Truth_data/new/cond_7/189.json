Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided in the arguments cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., linguistics, astronomy, economics, biology, etc.), and there is no semantic overlap between the justifications of any pair of arguments with respect to the claim about survivorship bias in investment returns. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
