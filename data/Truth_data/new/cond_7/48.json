Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share the common semantic theme that there are no legal protections or restrictions on killing praying mantises in the U.S., whether at the federal, state, or local level. Each argument reinforces this central idea from slightly different angles (e.g., federal laws, Endangered Species Act, state laws, agricultural benefits, local ordinances), but they all contribute to the same overarching support for the claim.
