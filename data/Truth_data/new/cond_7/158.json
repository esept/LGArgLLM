Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. For example, the argument about the "disproportionately high percentage of Nobel Prize winners" and the argument about "historical and cultural emphasis on education" both contribute to explaining why Jewish people have won more Nobel Prizes, indicating a shared semantic subset. Thus, no pair of arguments is completely disjoint.
