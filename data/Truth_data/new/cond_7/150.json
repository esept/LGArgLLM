Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly varied and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dreams, working hours, religious demographics, genetics, etc.). There is no semantic overlap between the justifications of any pair of arguments with respect to the claim about breast cancer and lung cancer deaths among women in the U.S. Thus, at least one pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
