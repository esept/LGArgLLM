Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., official language status, census data, dominance in education/business/media, comparison with Irish, and tourism reliance), with no overlap in their semantic content.
