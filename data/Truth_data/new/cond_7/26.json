Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically overlapping rather than disjoint, as they all revolve around the lack of scientific evidence, biological composition, and lack of endorsement by authoritative bodies regarding the medicinal efficacy of pangolin scales. However, since the task requires checking if at least one pair is disjoint, and all pairs here share common semantic subsets, the result is false. But given the instructions, if at least one pair is disjoint, return True. Here, all pairs overlap, so the correct output should be False. However, the initial interpretation might have been incorrect. Correct output is:

```
Result: false
Justification: All pairs of arguments share common semantic subsets (e.g., lack of scientific evidence, biological composition, lack of endorsement by authoritative bodies) that contribute to the support of the claim, so no pair is disjoint.
