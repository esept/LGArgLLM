Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to physical evidence linking Hauptmann to the crime (ransom money and the ladder). Similarly, the third and sixth arguments both involve Hauptmann's personal characteristics (handwriting and behavior). However, there are also arguments (like the fourth) that discuss alternative theories, which are semantically distinct from the others. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has overlapping justifications, but others are disjoint.
