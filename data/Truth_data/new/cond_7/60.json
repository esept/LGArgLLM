Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., vocal anatomy limitations, lack of evidence, cognitive requirements, lack of understanding in mimicry, and absence of cultural learning). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
