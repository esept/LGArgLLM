Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly diverse and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dreams, dietary laws, economic data, climate, etc.). There is no semantic overlap between the justifications of any pair of arguments that would contribute to supporting the claim about birds becoming fluent in English. Therefore, at least one pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
