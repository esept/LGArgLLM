Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are highly diverse and cover a wide range of unrelated topics (e.g., dreams, dietary laws, historical events, scientific studies, etc.). There is no common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim about Ulstermen referring to New York City in a specific way. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
