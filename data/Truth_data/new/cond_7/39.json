Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to demographic surveys and statistical data from Canada, which overlap in supporting the claim about the proportion of straight people. Similarly, the third and fifth arguments both discuss international or global trends, which also overlap. Therefore, there are pairs of arguments whose justifications share common semantic subsets supporting the claim.
