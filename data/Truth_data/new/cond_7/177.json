Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference France's legal protections for freedom of expression (e.g., "France has strong legal protections for freedom of expression" and "International human rights agreements that France has ratified discourage censorship of artistic works"). Additionally, several arguments mention the rarity of film bans due to judicial processes or societal norms (e.g., "The French legal system requires a judicial decision to ban a film, which is a rare occurrence" and "Most films that were historically banned in France have since been legalized due to changing societal norms"). These overlaps mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
