Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that some birds have become fluent in English. The arguments and their justifications are unrelated to the claim, discussing topics such as language teaching, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and other unrelated subjects. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim about birds and English fluency.
