Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They collectively argue that adopting power poses (expansive, high-power postures) leads to increased feelings of power and confidence, backed by evidence such as hormonal changes (testosterone and cortisol), psychological research on body posture and self-perception, and the broader concept of embodied cognition. The intersection of these justifications consistently reinforces the claim's fundamental principle.
