Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by emphasizing the recovery and proper burial of deceased workers, adherence to safety protocols, lack of credible evidence for bodies being buried in the dam, and involvement of families in the burial process. This consistent theme across all arguments confirms that there is a shared semantic basis for the claim.
