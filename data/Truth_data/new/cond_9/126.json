Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not relate to the claim about bitcoin's value over time. Instead, they cover a wide range of unrelated topics such as language teaching, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and other disparate subjects. There is no common semantic core that supports the claim about bitcoin's future value based on its past performance.
