Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that distinguishes between short-term weather events (like a cold day) and long-term climate trends (global warming). They collectively argue that local or temporary cold weather does not contradict global warming, as the latter is defined by long-term patterns and averages. This consistent theme across all arguments forms a shared semantic basis for the claim.
