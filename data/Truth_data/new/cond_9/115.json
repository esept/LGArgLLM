Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that the body's natural detoxification systems (e.g., liver, kidneys) are already efficient and do not require juice fasts, and that juice fasts lack scientific support for detoxification. This shared basis collectively supports the claim that juice fasts cannot detoxify the body.
