Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Each argument presents a distinct reason (e.g., smoking adoption, improved diagnostics, occupational exposure, longer life expectancy, environmental pollution, public health campaigns) for the increase in lung cancer rates among American men. While all support the claim, they do so through different mechanisms or factors, indicating no single shared semantic basis.
