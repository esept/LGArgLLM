Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They collectively describe how porcupines use their tails and quills as a defense mechanism, detailing the mechanics (swinging tails, detachable quills), the effects (painful injuries, barbed quills), and the behavior (passive defense, controlled swings). This intersection of meaning consistently backs the claim that porcupines attack by swinging their tails into predators.
