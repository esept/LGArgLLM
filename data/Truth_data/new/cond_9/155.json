Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that Jews speak multiple languages due to historical, geographical, and cultural diversity, rather than a single shared language. Each argument supports this core idea by highlighting different aspects (liturgical vs. spoken languages, regional influences, historical languages, global dispersion, multilingualism). Thus, there is a clear intersection in meaning across all justifications.
