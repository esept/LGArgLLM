Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not relate to the claim about Donald Trump being the most recent U.S. president not selected as Time's Person of the Year. The arguments cover a wide range of unrelated topics, and none of them address the specific claim about Time's Person of the Year or Donald Trump's status in that context. Therefore, there is no common semantic intersection supporting the claim.
