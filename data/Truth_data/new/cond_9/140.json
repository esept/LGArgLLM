Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments cover different aspects of Donald Sutherland's life and career (acting career, distinctive looks, personal life, online presence, political views, and filmography). While they all contribute to the overall claim, there is no single semantic core that is shared across all justifications. Each justification supports a different part of the claim rather than a common intersection.
