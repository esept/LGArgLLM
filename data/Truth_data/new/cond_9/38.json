Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim. While they individually support parts of the claim (e.g., Iceland's small size, Christian majority, and pleasant living conditions), none of them address the key aspect of the claim regarding Iceland being "annexed and taken over by a great continental power." Therefore, there is no common intersection of all justifications that fully supports the claim.
