Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a single semantic core. While they all support the claim that London gets more international arrivals than Paris, they do so through different and distinct reasons (e.g., financial hub status, flight connections, visa policies, language convenience, etc.). There is no single overlapping semantic basis across all justifications.
