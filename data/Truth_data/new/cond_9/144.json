Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that Earth possesses unique and rare conditions (e.g., liquid water, stable atmosphere, suitable temperature, protection from radiation, geological activity) necessary for life, and no other planet has been found to meet these criteria. This collective reasoning supports the claim that Earth is the only planet capable of supporting life.
