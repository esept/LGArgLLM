Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core: each justification cites a specific diet (e.g., Mediterranean, DASH, plant-based, intermittent fasting, low-fat, ketogenic) and explicitly states that it has been scientifically shown to promote weight loss through distinct mechanisms. This collective evidence supports the claim that various diets, not just carb-cutting, are effective for weight loss.
