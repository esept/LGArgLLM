Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim about the meaning of 'AD' in the Gregorian calendar. The arguments and their justifications are unrelated to the claim, discussing various unrelated topics such as dietary habits, economic data, and cultural practices, rather than the historical or linguistic basis of the term 'AD'.
