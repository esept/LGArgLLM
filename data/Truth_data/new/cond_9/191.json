Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not relate to the claim "America has fewer obese people than Australia." Instead, they cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as language teaching, dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and more. There is no common semantic core that supports the claim about obesity rates in America versus Australia.
