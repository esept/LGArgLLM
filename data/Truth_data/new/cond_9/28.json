Result: false  
Justification: While the justifications for Germany and France both support the claim by stating that these countries use the euro as their official currency, the argument for Switzerland is missing. Since Switzerland does not use the euro (it uses the Swiss franc), the claim is not fully supported by all justifications. Therefore, there is no common semantic intersection across all P-type arguments.
