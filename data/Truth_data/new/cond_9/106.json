Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that parents pass on exactly 50% of their genes to their child, while siblings share approximately 50% due to genetic recombination. This directly supports the claim that parents share more genes with their child than siblings do, as the parent-child relationship is consistently 50%, whereas sibling sharing can vary around 50%.
