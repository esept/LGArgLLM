Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim about Amy Cuddy's power poses. The arguments are disjointed and cover unrelated topics, such as dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and other unrelated claims, rather than focusing on the specific claim about power poses. Therefore, there is no intersection of justifications that collectively support the claim.
