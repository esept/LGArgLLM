Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that Scotland and England merged to form the UK while Scotland retained distinct legal, political, and cultural identities separate from England. Each argument supports the claim by emphasizing different aspects of this shared basis (e.g., historical union, legal autonomy, political devolution, national recognition, preserved identity, and cultural distinctness).
