Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not relate to the claim "In Scotland, they all speak Scottish." The arguments and their justifications cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as dreams, working hours, religious demographics, and economic comparisons, none of which support or oppose the claim about language in Scotland. Therefore, there is no common semantic intersection supporting the claim.
