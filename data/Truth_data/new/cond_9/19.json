Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core of comparing income inequality between the US and Brazil, using metrics like the Gini coefficient, middle class size, social welfare programs, poverty rates, labor protections, and educational access. Each argument supports the claim by highlighting different aspects where the US performs better than Brazil in reducing income inequality.
