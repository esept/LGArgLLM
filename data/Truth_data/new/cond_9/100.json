Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a single semantic core. While they all relate to the claim about increased working hours, they cite different reasons (e.g., labor statistics, technological advancements, gig economy, historical data, workplace cultures, economic pressures). There is no single overlapping justification that all arguments rely on to support the claim.
