Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core related to the claim about the Aztec Empire. The arguments and their justifications cover a wide range of unrelated topics, and none of them directly address the historical existence or timeline of the Aztec Empire. Therefore, there is no shared semantic basis supporting the claim.
