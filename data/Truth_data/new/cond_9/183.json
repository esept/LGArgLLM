Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that explains how the U.S. tax system's marginal and progressive nature ensures that only the portion of income within a higher bracket is taxed at that rate, thereby guaranteeing an increase in take-home earnings despite moving to a higher tax bracket. Each justification reinforces this central idea, making the support for the claim consistent and unified.
