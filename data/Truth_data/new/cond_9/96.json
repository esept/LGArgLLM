Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not relate to the claim about carrying guns legally in the US. The arguments and their justifications cover a wide range of unrelated topics, such as dreams, dietary habits, and historical events, but none address the legal aspects of gun carrying in the US. Therefore, there is no common semantic core supporting the claim.
