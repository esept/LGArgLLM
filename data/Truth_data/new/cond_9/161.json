Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the claim "Libras are known to be smart and charming" do not share a common semantic core. While some justifications focus on charm (e.g., being ruled by Venus, strong interpersonal skills), others focus on intelligence (e.g., being an air sign, diplomatic and articulate traits). There is no single shared semantic basis that all justifications collectively support for both "smart" and "charming."
