Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share the common semantic core that truthful speech is protected under U.S. defamation law, as false statements are a necessary element for a defamation claim. Each justification reinforces this idea by highlighting different aspects of the legal framework (e.g., First Amendment protection, burden of proof, distinction between facts and opinions, substantial truth), but all converge on the principle that truth is a defense against defamation.
