Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim about infrared cameras being used to find ghosts. The arguments and their justifications are unrelated to the claim, covering a wide range of unrelated topics. Therefore, there is no shared semantic basis for the claim across all P-type arguments.
