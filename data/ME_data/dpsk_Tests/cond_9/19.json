Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that equal angles (60Â° each) in a triangle imply equal sides, which is the definition of an equilateral triangle. Each argument uses different geometric principles (ASA congruence, angle sum property, Law of Sines, etc.) to arrive at the same conclusion, reinforcing the same semantic basis for the claim.
