Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the semantic core that the claim is logically valid and biologically accurate due to the classification of dogs as mammals and poodles as dogs. Each justification supports this core in slightly different ways (e.g., syllogistic structure, deductive reasoning, biological taxonomy), but they all converge on the same fundamental support for the claim.
