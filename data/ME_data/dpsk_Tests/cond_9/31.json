Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The arguments reference different events (U.S. presidential elections, leap years, Summer Olympics, FIFA World Cup) that each follow a 4-year cycle, but they do not collectively support the same specific basis for the claim. The claim is about "an event" in general, but the justifications refer to distinct events with their own cycles.
