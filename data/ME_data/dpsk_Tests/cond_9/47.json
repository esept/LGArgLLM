Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that lightning reaches higher temperatures than the surface of the Sun, supported by scientific measurements and explanations of thermal energy. Each argument reinforces this central idea with different details (e.g., temperature values, electron movement, spectroscopy studies), but all converge on the same conclusion.
