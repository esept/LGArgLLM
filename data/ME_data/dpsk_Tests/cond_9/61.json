Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that Nelson Mandela was the first black president of South Africa, supported by historical events (1994 elections, end of apartheid), political context (transition from white minority rule), and authoritative sources (government records, biographies, ANC leadership). The overlap in meaning is consistent and unambiguous.
