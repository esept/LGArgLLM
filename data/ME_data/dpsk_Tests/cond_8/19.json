Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that equal angles (60Â° each) in a triangle imply equal sides, making the triangle equilateral. The justifications overlap semantically by referencing geometric principles (ASA congruence, equiangular implies equilateral, Law of Sines) that all lead to the same conclusion.
