Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea of the transitive property of inequality, either explicitly (e.g., "transitive property of inequality") or implicitly (e.g., "relationship logically consistent," "empirical observations," "formal logic"). This semantic overlap ensures that every pair of arguments intersects in their justification of the claim.
