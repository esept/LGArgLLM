Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the expression (2 + 3) × (1 + 1) simplifies to 10 through mathematical operations. Each argument either explicitly states the steps of simplification (e.g., 5 × 2 = 10) or confirms the correctness of the calculation, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
