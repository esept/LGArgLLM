Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the mathematical operations (addition and multiplication) are correctly applied according to established rules (order of operations, distributive property) to arrive at the result 18. Each argument reinforces this core idea through different reasoning patterns (PEMDAS, direct computation, computational consistency, distributive property), ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
