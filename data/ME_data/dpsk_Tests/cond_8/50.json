Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Albert Einstein is the formulator of the theory of relativity, either by citing specific contributions (special and general relativity, E=mcÂ²), experimental confirmations, historical records, or the impact of his work on modern physics. Each pair of arguments overlaps in supporting this central claim through different facets of Einstein's work and its validation.
