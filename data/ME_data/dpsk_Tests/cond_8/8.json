Result: true
Justification: All arguments share a common semantic theme of legal and institutional protections for freedom of speech in democratic nations. Each justification either references constitutional protections, international agreements, judicial enforcement, free press, public discourse, or legal mechanisms, all of which are interconnected aspects of how democratic nations protect freedom of speech. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their support for the claim through these related justifications.
