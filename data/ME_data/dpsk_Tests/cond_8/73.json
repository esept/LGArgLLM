Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that a square meets the definition of a rectangle, either by having four sides and four right angles, being a special case of a rectangle, or being included in the mathematical definition of rectangles. The justifications consistently reinforce the hierarchical relationship between squares and rectangles, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
