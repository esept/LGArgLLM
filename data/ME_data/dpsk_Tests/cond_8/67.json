Result: true
Justification: All justifications for the arguments essentially state that the claim is a tautology, meaning it is logically true by definition. They all overlap in their reasoning that the claim is inherently true because it is a repetition of the same condition or follows the form 'if P, then P' in propositional logic. Therefore, every pair of arguments shares a common idea in their justification.
