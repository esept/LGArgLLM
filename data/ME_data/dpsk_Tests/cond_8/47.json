Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly compares the temperature of lightning and the Sun's surface (e.g., 30,000 Kelvin vs. 5,500 Kelvin) or explains the scientific basis for why lightning is hotter (e.g., rapid electron movement, concentrated energy, or spectroscopic measurements). These justifications consistently reinforce the claim by referencing temperature comparisons or the mechanisms behind lightning's high temperature.
