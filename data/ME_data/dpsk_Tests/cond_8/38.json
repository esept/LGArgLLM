Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain above sea level, as confirmed by various authoritative sources, measurements, and recognitions. Each argument reinforces this central idea through different forms of evidence (geodetic surveys, peer-reviewed literature, UIAA recognition, National Geographic, satellite measurements, and official recognition by Nepal and China), but all overlap in supporting the claim's core proposition.
