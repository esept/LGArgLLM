Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly states that antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections, provides evidence from clinical studies or medical guidelines, explains the mechanism of action (e.g., disrupting bacterial processes), or cites historical or laboratory evidence supporting the claim. The common idea across all justifications is the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections, either through direct action, empirical evidence, or mechanistic explanation.
