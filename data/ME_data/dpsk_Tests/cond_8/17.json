Result: true
Justification: All justifications for the arguments share the common idea that the square root of 16 is 4 based on mathematical definitions, equations, and universally accepted standards. Each justification reinforces this claim by providing overlapping reasoning (e.g., y² = x, x² = 16, and consistency in textbooks/calculators), ensuring semantic intersection in every pair of arguments.
