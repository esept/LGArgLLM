Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly references fever as a response to infection, cites clinical or epidemiological evidence, or mentions medical guidelines that link fever to infections. The common theme across all justifications is the established connection between fever and infection, whether through immune response mechanisms, clinical studies, or medical protocols.
