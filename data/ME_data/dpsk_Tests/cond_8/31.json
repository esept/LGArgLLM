Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument discusses U.S. presidential elections, the second discusses leap years, the third discusses the Summer Olympics, and the fourth discusses the FIFA World Cup. While all are events that occur every 4 years, they are distinct events with no overlapping semantic justifications beyond the general 4-year cycle. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications.
