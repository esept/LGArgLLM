Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) prioritizes multiplication over addition, leading to the correct result of 14. Each argument reinforces this idea with slight variations (e.g., mathematical conventions, standard arithmetic rules, educational curricula), ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
