Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that a prime number is defined as being divisible only by 1 and itself. This core definition is explicitly stated or implicitly supported in each justification, whether through mathematical proofs, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, examples of prime numbers, primality tests, or educational consensus. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in their justification of the claim.
