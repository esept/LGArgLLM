Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the claim is a direct consequence of the transitive property of equality, which is a foundational axiom in mathematics and logic. Each argument either explicitly mentions the transitive property or describes a reasoning pattern (e.g., substitution) that relies on it, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
