Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to different aspects of Einstein's formulation of the theory of relativity, such as the publication of special and general relativity, the famous equation E=mcÂ², experimental confirmations, historical attribution, and the impact on modern physics. These justifications overlap in their support of the claim by collectively reinforcing Einstein's role in formulating the theory of relativity.
