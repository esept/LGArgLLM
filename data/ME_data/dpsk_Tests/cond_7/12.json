Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both mention the concept of generating additional income (through interest or returns in the first argument and compound interest in the second), which is a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim. Similarly, the third and fifth arguments both touch on the idea of reducing financial stress or debt, which also overlaps in meaning. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have disjoint justifications.
