Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, A1 and A3 both reference the temperature of lightning and the Sun's surface, and A2 and A4 both discuss the mechanisms or reasons behind the high temperature of lightning. There is overlap in the semantic content of these justifications with respect to the claim.
