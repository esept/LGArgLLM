Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that fever is a common sign of infection. Each justification provides a different perspective or evidence (e.g., immune response, clinical studies, medical guidelines, pyrogens, epidemiological data, healthcare protocols) but all converge on the same core idea. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
