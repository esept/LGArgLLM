Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. They all revolve around the idea that a square meets the definition of a rectangle, either by having four sides and right angles, being a special case of a rectangle, or being explicitly included in the definition of rectangles. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
