Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all ultimately demonstrate that the expression (2 + 3) Ã— (1 + 1) simplifies to 10 through different but overlapping reasoning (e.g., simplification, order of operations, direct calculation). No pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
