Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that Nelson Mandela was the first black president of South Africa. Each argument provides different details (e.g., the year 1994, the end of apartheid, the transition to majority rule, official records, ANC's role) but all ultimately support the same core claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
