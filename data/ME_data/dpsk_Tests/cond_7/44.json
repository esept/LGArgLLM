Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or piece of evidence supporting the claim that Brazil is located in South America, without overlapping in meaning. For example, one argument discusses Brazil's size and population, another its geographical borders, another its official language, another its membership in a regional organization, another the Amazon Rainforest, and another its time zones. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
