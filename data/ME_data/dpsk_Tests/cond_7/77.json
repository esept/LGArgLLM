Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the heart's location in the chest, as they all provide different types of evidence (anatomical studies, medical imaging, textbooks, physical examinations, surgical procedures, and structural protection) that support the same claim. None of the pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
