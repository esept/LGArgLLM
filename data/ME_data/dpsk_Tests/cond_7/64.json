Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, the first argument mentions gasoline as the primary fuel for internal combustion engines, while the third argument states that most cars are designed to run on gasoline. Both justifications contribute to the claim by highlighting gasoline's dominance in the car fuel market. Therefore, there is no pair of arguments with disjoint justifications.
