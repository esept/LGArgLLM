Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all share a common semantic subset related to the linear increase in age over time and the arithmetic calculation of adding the years passed to the initial age. For example, the first argument mentions the linear increase in age, while the second and third arguments explicitly perform the arithmetic calculation (10 + 15 = 25). The fourth argument also refers to the linear function of age calculation. Thus, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
