Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first argument's justification ("Australia is recognized as a continent by geographic standards due to its distinct landmass and tectonic plate.") and the third argument's justification ("The term 'Australia' refers to both the landmass and the political entity, as it is the only country occupying the continent.") both discuss the continental aspect of Australia, indicating an overlap in semantic content with respect to the claim.
