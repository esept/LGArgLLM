Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct reasons supporting the claim. The first justification explains the etymological origin of 'Au', the second cites the official designation by IUPAC, the third references standard educational materials, and the fourth points to usage in scientific literature. None of these justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
