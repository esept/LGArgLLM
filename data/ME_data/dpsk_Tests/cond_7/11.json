Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that credit scores are used by lenders to assess risk (e.g., A1, A6) or that they influence loan terms or approval (e.g., A2, A3, A5). These justifications share common semantic subsets that contribute to supporting the claim, so they are not disjoint.
