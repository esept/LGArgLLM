Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and third arguments both refer to the logical structure of the claim (syllogism and deductive reasoning), and the second and fourth arguments both refer to biological classification. Thus, there is semantic overlap between some pairs of arguments.
