Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing different forms of support for the formula of the area of a rectangle being length Ã— width. For example, one argument references mathematical textbooks, another empirical measurements, and another dimensional analysis, but all ultimately support the same claim without being disjoint in their semantic contributions.
