Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that the boiling point of water at sea level is 100Â°C. They all refer to definitions, empirical measurements, scientific consensus, historical definitions, laboratory experiments, or thermodynamic properties that confirm this fact. None of the pairs of arguments have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
