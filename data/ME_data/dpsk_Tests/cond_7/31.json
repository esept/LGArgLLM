Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct example of an event that occurs every 4 years (U.S. presidential elections, leap years, Summer Olympics, FIFA World Cup), and none of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim beyond their individual examples.
