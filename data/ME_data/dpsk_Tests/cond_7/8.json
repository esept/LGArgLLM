Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the protection of freedom of speech in democratic nations. For example, the First Amendment and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights both refer to legal or constitutional protections, while independent judiciaries and legal frameworks both mention enforcement mechanisms. These overlaps mean the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
