Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on the obscurity or lack of publication of the law as a rare exception, while the second justification discusses specific legal doctrines like 'mistake of law' in narrow contexts. These are distinct reasons and do not intersect semantically to form a unified basis for the claim.
