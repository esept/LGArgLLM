Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They all revolve around the fact that 6 is the product of 2 and 3, and thus any number divisible by 6 must inherently be divisible by both 2 and 3. This is supported by definitions, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, empirical evidence, and modular arithmetic principles.
