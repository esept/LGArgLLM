Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the claim is mathematically correct and logically consistent with the given age difference. The first argument explicitly states the arithmetic calculation, the second assumes the constant age difference, and the third affirms the logical consistency with arithmetic principles. Thus, all pairs of arguments overlap in their justifications regarding the mathematical correctness and logical consistency of the claim.
