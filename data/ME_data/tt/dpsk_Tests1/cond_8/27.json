Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 correctly evaluates to 18. The first argument justifies this by detailing the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), while the second argument supports it by stating the universality and correctness of the result. Both justifications converge on the correctness of the arithmetic operation, thus sharing a semantic overlap.
