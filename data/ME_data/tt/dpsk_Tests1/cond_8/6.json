Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument discusses civil penalties in some jurisdictions, the second focuses on war crimes tribunals invoking higher moral or international law, and the third addresses corporate or professional disciplinary actions. These are distinct scenarios with no overlapping semantic content in their justifications.
