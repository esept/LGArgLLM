Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that excessive water intake can lead to hyponatremia. The first argument focuses on athletes and overhydration during physical activity, while the second argument explains the physiological mechanism involving the kidneys' limited capacity to excrete excess water. Despite the different angles, both justifications support the claim by highlighting scenarios or mechanisms where excessive water consumption results in hyponatremia.
