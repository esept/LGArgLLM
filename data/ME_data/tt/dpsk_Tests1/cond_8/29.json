Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. The common idea is that divisibility by 6 inherently requires divisibility by both 2 and 3, either through the definition of 6 as the product of 2 and 3, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, empirical evidence, or modular arithmetic. Each justification reinforces this core idea, ensuring overlap in meaning across all pairs.
