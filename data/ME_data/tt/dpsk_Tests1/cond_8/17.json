Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the independent but overlapping contributions of Newton and Leibniz to the development of calculus, their publications, the priority dispute, their distinct notations, and their complementary approaches. These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments has at least one shared idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
