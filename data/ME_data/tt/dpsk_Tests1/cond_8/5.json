Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that coercion invalidates a contract by undermining mutual consent or voluntary agreement, which is a fundamental requirement for contract validity. Each argument supports this central theme from slightly different angles (legal recognition, principle of voluntary agreement, and practical consequence of rescission), but they all semantically overlap in their core justification.
