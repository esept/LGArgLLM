Result: true
Justification: Both arguments justify the claim by demonstrating that both sides of the equation simplify to the same value (15) under the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). The first argument explicitly mentions the order of operations and the simplification steps, while the second argument directly states the result of the simplification. Thus, their justifications share a common semantic overlap in relation to the claim.
