Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that pairing odd numbers and summing them results in an even number. The first argument explicitly states this for two odd numbers, while the second generalizes it to any finite set of odd numbers by pairing them. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
