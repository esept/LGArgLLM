Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument cites the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which explicitly states the principle of double jeopardy. The second argument expands on this by noting its recognition in many legal systems worldwide, reinforcing the idea of finality in criminal proceedings. The third argument further elaborates on the implications of double jeopardy, specifically regarding new evidence. All three arguments revolve around the core idea that double jeopardy prevents retrial for the same crime, ensuring consistency and protection for individuals. Thus, every pair of arguments shares at least one common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
