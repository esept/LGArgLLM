Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the equation 2² + 2² simplifies to 4 + 4, which equals 8, thereby confirming the claim. Each argument reinforces this basic arithmetic reasoning, either by explicitly stating the simplification process or by emphasizing the correctness of the operations involved.
