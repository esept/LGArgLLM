Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the obscurity or lack of publication of the law as a rare exception, while the second argument discusses specific legal doctrines like 'mistake of law' in narrow contexts such as tax law. These justifications do not intersect in terms of common ideas, propositions, or reasoning patterns.
