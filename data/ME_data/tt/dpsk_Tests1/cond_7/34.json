Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the definition and universal recognition of birth order determining age. For example, the first and second justifications both refer to the definition or standard chronological systems, while the third also aligns with this by mentioning legal and social conventions. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
