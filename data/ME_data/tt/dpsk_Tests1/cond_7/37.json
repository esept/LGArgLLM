Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first argument's justification ("All cats are members of the biological family Felidae, which is classified under the class Mammalia, meaning all cats are mammals by definition.") and the second argument's justification ("Tigers (Panthera tigris) are scientifically classified under the Felidae family, which confirms their membership in the cat family.") both discuss the classification of cats and tigers under the Felidae family, which is a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim. Therefore, the justifications overlap in meaning.
