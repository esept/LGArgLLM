Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument discusses civil penalties in some jurisdictions, the second focuses on war crimes tribunals invoking higher moral or international law, and the third addresses corporate or professional disciplinary actions. Each justification addresses a distinct scenario where retroactive punishment can occur, without overlapping in meaning.
