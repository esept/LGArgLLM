Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on cases where the law is obscure or not published, while the second argument discusses specific legal doctrines like 'mistake of law' in narrow contexts such as tax law. There is no overlap in their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
