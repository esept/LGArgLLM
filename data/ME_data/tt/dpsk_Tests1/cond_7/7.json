Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the protection of individuals from false accusations, while the second argument cites international human rights documents as evidence of global acceptance. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
