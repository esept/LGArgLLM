Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the independent but overlapping discoveries of Newton and Leibniz (e.g., historical records, publications, and the priority dispute). Additionally, the distinct contributions (notation, focus) are mentioned in multiple arguments, further indicating semantic overlap. Thus, no pair of arguments is fully disjoint in their justifications.
