Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share the same semantic justification that the equation holds true because both sides simplify to 15. The first argument provides additional detail about the order of operations, but the core justification (both sides equal 15) is the same in both arguments. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
