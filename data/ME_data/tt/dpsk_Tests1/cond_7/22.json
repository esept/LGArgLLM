Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments share a common semantic subset related to Earth's status as a planet in the solar system. The first argument focuses on Earth orbiting the Sun, the second adds more specific criteria (mass and cleared orbit), and the third mentions the scientific consensus. All contribute to supporting the claim, and none are disjoint.
