Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. All arguments rely on the fact that 6 is composed of the primes 2 and 3, and thus any number divisible by 6 must also be divisible by both 2 and 3. The arguments differ in the way they present this fact (definition, Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, empirical testing, modular arithmetic), but the core semantic content overlaps.
