Result: false
Justification: All arguments share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that China's population exceeds 1 billion. Each justification provides different evidence (census data, UN estimates, historical trends, growth trends, and mainland population) but all converge on the same conclusion. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
