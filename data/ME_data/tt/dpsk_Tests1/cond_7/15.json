Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments share a common semantic subset that supports the claim. Both arguments explain that when Xiaoming turns 30, his father will be 60 and his grandfather will be 90, forming an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 30. Therefore, their justifications are not disjoint.
