Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the claim by discussing the legal principles that invalidate a contract signed under coercion. They overlap in meaning as they all address the lack of mutual consent or voluntary agreement due to coercion, which is central to the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
