Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the mathematical correctness and logical consistency of the claim. The first justification directly calculates the father's age, the second assumes the age difference remains constant, and the third refers to basic arithmetic principles. These justifications overlap in supporting the claim through mathematical and logical reasoning.
