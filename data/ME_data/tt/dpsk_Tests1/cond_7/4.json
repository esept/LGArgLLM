Result: true
Justification: The two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on a specific group (athletes, particularly marathon runners) and their risk of hyponatremia due to overhydration during prolonged physical activity. The second justification discusses the physiological limitation of the kidneys in excreting excess water, which is a general mechanism applicable to anyone. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications in supporting the claim.
