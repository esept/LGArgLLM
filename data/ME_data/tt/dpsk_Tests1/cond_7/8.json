Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, the second discusses the global recognition and purpose of the principle, and the third focuses on the irrelevance of new evidence post-trial. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
