Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the equation 2² + 2² = 8 holds true based on the correct application of arithmetic operations, specifically squaring and addition, and adherence to the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Each pair of arguments overlaps in their justification by referencing these fundamental principles.
