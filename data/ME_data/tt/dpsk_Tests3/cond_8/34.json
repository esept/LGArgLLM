Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the concept of age is directly tied to the chronological order of birth. Each argument emphasizes that being born earlier means having existed for a longer period of time, which is the core idea supporting the claim. Therefore, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
