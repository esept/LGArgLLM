Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that divisibility by 6 inherently requires divisibility by both 2 and 3, either through prime factorization, expression as a multiple of 6, or the relationship between the LCM of 2 and 3 and the number 6. Each pair of arguments overlaps in these fundamental concepts supporting the claim.
