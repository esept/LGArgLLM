Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that a geometric sequence requires a constant ratio between consecutive terms, and they all use the same reasoning to show that the given ages (60, 30, 0) satisfy this condition with a ratio of 0.5 (or half the previous term). The semantic overlap is clear across all pairs of arguments.
