Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that tigers are mammals because they belong to the cat family (Felidae), which is universally recognized as part of the mammalian lineage. Each argument either directly states this or provides additional supporting evidence (e.g., scientific taxonomy, possession of hair) that reinforces the same core idea. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their semantic justifications with respect to the claim.
