Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that France uses the euro as its official currency, either by virtue of its membership in the European Union, the legal status of the euro since 1999, French law designating the euro as the sole official currency, or the role of the Banque de France in managing the euro. Each pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim through these related justifications.
