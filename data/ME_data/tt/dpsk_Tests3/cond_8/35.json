Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the passage of time (10 years) from the age of 20 naturally results in the age of 30. This is supported by basic arithmetic, the continuous nature of aging, and the universally accepted method of age calculation. Therefore, all justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
