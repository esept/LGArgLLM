Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument contradicts the claim by stating that the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, while the second argument simply restates the claim without providing any justification. There is no common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
