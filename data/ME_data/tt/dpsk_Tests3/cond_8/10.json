Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Paris is recognized as the capital of France, whether through historical records, government institutions, or international recognition. Each pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim by reinforcing the central idea that Paris is the capital of France. For example, the historical argument overlaps with the official documents argument, and the government institutions argument overlaps with the international recognition argument.
