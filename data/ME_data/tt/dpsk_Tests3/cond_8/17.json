Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to the joint discovery of calculus by Newton and Leibniz.

For example, the first and second arguments both mention independent discovery, the third and fourth both highlight distinct contributions, and the fifth and first both reference awareness of each other's work while maintaining independent methods.
