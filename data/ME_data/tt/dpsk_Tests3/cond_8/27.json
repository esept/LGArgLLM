Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 = 18 is correct based on standard arithmetic rules, such as the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), basic arithmetic, mathematical consistency, and the distributive property. Each justification overlaps in supporting the claim through these shared mathematical principles.
