Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification of explaining the principle of double jeopardy, which prohibits trying a person twice for the same crime. Each argument either directly states this principle or elaborates on its implications (e.g., legal basis, protections, exceptions), ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim.
