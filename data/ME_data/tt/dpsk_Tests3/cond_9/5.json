Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that coercion undermines the voluntary and mutual consent required for a valid contract, which is a foundational principle in contract law. Each argument reinforces this idea by mentioning legal requirements, principles of contract formation, or court rulings, all converging on the invalidity of coerced contracts.
