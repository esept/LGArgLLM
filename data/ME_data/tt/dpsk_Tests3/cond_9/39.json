Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core of logical deduction, specifically applying principles from classical logic (universal instantiation), Aristotelian logic (syllogism in Barbara form), set theory (subset relation), and mathematical logic (transitive property) to support the claim. Each justification reinforces the idea that the claim is a valid and fundamental logical inference.
