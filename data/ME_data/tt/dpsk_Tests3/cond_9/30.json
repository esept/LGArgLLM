Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification contradicts the claim by stating that the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, while the second justification simply restates the claim without providing any supporting reasoning. There is no intersection in meaning between the justifications.
