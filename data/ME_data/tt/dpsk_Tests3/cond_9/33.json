Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not consistently support the claim that the ages form a geometric sequence. While some arguments correctly identify the common ratio of 0.5 between the grandfather and father (60 to 30), they incorrectly apply the same ratio to the father and grandson (30 to 0). A geometric sequence cannot have a term of 0 with a non-zero common ratio, as it would imply division by zero in subsequent terms. Therefore, there is no common semantic core that supports the claim across all arguments.
