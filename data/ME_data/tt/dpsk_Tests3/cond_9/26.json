Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that the equation 2² + 2² equals 8 by correctly applying the order of operations (exponents before addition) and performing the arithmetic (2² = 4, 4 + 4 = 8). Each argument reinforces this shared understanding, confirming the claim's validity.
