Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content, as they all relate to the principle of "presumption of innocence" and its importance in ensuring fair trials, protecting human rights, and upholding justice. For example, multiple arguments mention the burden of proof lying with the prosecution and the protection from arbitrary punishment, which are closely related concepts. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
