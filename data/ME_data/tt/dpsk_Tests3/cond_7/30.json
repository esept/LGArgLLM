Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument's justification contradicts the claim by stating that the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is always odd, while the second argument's justification simply restates the claim without providing any supporting reasoning. There is no overlap in their semantic content that contributes to supporting the claim.
