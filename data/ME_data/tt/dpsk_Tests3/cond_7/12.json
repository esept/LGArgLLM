Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are all distinct and do not overlap in meaning. Each argument provides a separate and independent reason (birth in the U.S., holding a U.S. passport, serving as President, citizenship by descent, and public identification as an American) supporting the claim that Donald Trump is an American. Thus, there is at least one pair of arguments (in fact, all pairs) whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
