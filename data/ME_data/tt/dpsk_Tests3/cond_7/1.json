Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to how insulin lowers blood sugar levels through different mechanisms (e.g., glucose uptake by cells, storage as glycogen, inhibition of glucose production, conversion to fat, and prevention of fat breakdown). None of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
