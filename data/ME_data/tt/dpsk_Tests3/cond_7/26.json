Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is the correctness of the equation 2² + 2² = 8 based on arithmetic operations and order of operations. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all reinforce the same conclusion using slightly different phrasing or emphasis.
