Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around the independent contributions of Newton and Leibniz to calculus, their distinct methods and notations, and the recognition of their work by historical and modern sources. There is significant semantic overlap in how these justifications support the claim, as they all address the joint and independent nature of their discoveries. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
