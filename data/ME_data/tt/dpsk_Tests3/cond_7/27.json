Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim, as they all rely on the correctness of the arithmetic operations involved in the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 = 18. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to the same conclusion using slightly different reasoning (order of operations, basic arithmetic, mathematical consistency, distributive property).
