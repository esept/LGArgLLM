Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to the classification of tigers within the cat family (Felidae) and their status as mammals. Similarly, the third and fifth arguments both mention scientific taxonomy and the mammalian lineage. Since there is overlap in the semantic content of these justifications, they are not disjoint.
