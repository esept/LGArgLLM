Given the arguments provided, let's analyze their justifications with respect to the claim.

Argument 1:
- Justification: "The right side of the equation, 3 * 5, equals 15, which matches the result of the left side when the correct order of operations is applied."

Argument 2:
- Justification: "The equation holds true only when the standard mathematical convention of operator precedence is followed, as both sides then yield the same result (15)."

Both justifications refer to the same core idea: the equation holds true when the standard order of operations is applied, resulting in both sides equaling 15. They are not semantically disjoint; they overlap in their support of the claim by emphasizing the importance of operator precedence and the resulting equality.

Since there are no pairs of arguments with semantically disjoint justifications in this case, the result is False.

```
Result: false
Justification: Both arguments' justifications overlap in their emphasis on the standard order of operations leading to the equation holding true (both sides equaling 15). There are no semantically disjoint pairs.
