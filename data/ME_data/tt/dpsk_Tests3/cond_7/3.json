Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided in the arguments are entirely unrelated to the claim about the heart's location. They discuss Roman architecture and the term 'vomitorium,' which has no semantic overlap with the claim. Therefore, all pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
