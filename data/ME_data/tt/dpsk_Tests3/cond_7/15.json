Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the ages of Xiaoming, his father, and his grandfather forming an arithmetic sequence when Xiaoming turns 30. Specifically, they all contribute to the support of the claim by detailing the ages and the constant difference between them, which is necessary for an arithmetic sequence. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
