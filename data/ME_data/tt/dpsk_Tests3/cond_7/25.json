Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that China's population is over 1 billion. Each justification provides different sources or evidence (e.g., official census data, historical context, UN estimates, national statistical yearbooks, international databases) but all converge on the same core idea supporting the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
