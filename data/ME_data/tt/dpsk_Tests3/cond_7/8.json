Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to the legal principle of double jeopardy and its constitutional basis, which overlaps in meaning. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both discuss the protective aspect of double jeopardy against repeated prosecutions. Therefore, there are semantic overlaps among the justifications.
