Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the importance of the presumption of innocence in legal systems, its foundational role in human rights and due process, and its protective function against unjust punishment and wrongful convictions. The common themes of fairness, legal rights, and protection from miscarriages of justice ensure that every pair of arguments intersects semantically.
