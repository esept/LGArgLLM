Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the definition or recognition of "grandfather" (whether genealogical, legal, or biological) is based on the transitive nature of the father relationship. Each argument explicitly or implicitly relies on the idea that A being the father of B and B being the father of C necessarily makes A the grandfather of C by some standard (genealogical, legal, or biological). Thus, all pairs of arguments overlap in their core reasoning.
