Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the principle of double jeopardy, its legal basis (e.g., Fifth Amendment, international human rights law), its scope (e.g., final verdict requirement, exclusion of civil lawsuits), or its purpose (e.g., protection against government overreach). These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments intersects in meaning with respect to the claim.
