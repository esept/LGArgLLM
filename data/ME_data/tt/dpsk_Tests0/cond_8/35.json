Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument relies on the fundamental idea that age increases linearly with time (specifically, 10 years added to 20 results in 30). The justifications differ slightly in phrasing but all support the claim by reinforcing the same arithmetic and temporal reasoning.
