Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that tigers, as members of the cat family (Felidae), possess mammalian traits and are classified as mammals by biological taxonomy. Each argument reinforces this core idea, either by referencing taxonomic classification (e.g., "Felidae are mammals") or by listing specific mammalian traits (e.g., "mammary glands," "live birth"). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim through these shared justifications.
