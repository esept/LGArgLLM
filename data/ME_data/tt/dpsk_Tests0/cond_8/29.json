Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that divisibility by 6 inherently requires divisibility by its prime factors 2 and 3, either through direct reference to the prime factorization of 6, the mathematical expression of divisibility, or the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
