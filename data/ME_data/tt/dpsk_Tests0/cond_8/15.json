Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the ages of Xiaoming, his father, and his grandfather form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 30 when Xiaoming turns 30. The justifications all reference this arithmetic property and the specific ages (30, 60, 90) that satisfy it, ensuring semantic overlap between every pair of arguments.
