Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the equation 2² + 2² = 8 is correct because squaring 2 yields 4, and adding two instances of 4 results in 8. Each argument reinforces this core idea, either through direct calculation, reference to the order of operations, or alignment with mathematical definitions.
