```
Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 = 18 holds true due to the correct application of arithmetic operations, specifically the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), where the parentheses are evaluated first (4 + 2 = 6) and then multiplied by 3 to yield 18. Each argument reinforces this reasoning, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
