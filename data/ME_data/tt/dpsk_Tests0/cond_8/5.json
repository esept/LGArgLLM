Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument revolves around the core idea that coercion or duress invalidates a contract by undermining mutual consent, voluntary agreement, or genuine consent, which are foundational principles in contract law. The justifications consistently reference legal concepts like mutual consent, duress, autonomy, and the "meeting of the minds," ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
