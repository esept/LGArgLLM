Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to criteria or characteristics that define Earth as a planet (orbiting the Sun and meeting IAU criteria). Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both reference scientific consensus or observations confirming Earth's planetary status. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are entirely semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
