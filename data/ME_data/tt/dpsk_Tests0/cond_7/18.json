Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the transitive property of age or chronological ordering. For example, the first, third, and fourth justifications explicitly mention the transitive property or linear ordering, while the second and fifth justifications refer to chronological or temporal sequences. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
