Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct scenario or mechanism (e.g., international human rights tribunals, judicial reinterpretation, civil penalties, transitional justice mechanisms) under which a person can be punished for an act that was legal when committed. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
