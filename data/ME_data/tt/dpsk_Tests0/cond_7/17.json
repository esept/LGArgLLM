Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the joint discovery of calculus by Newton and Leibniz (e.g., Leibniz's publication, the Royal Society's report, modern historians' consensus, and the timing of Newton's publication). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
