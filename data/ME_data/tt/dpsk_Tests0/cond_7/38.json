Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all rely on the definitions or principles of genealogy, family relationships, or biological lineage to conclude that A is the grandfather of C. None of the pairs of arguments have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
