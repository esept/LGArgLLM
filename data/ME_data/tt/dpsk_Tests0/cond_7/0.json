Result: false
Justification: All justifications provided share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that the human body has 206 bones. They all refer to authoritative sources (anatomical studies, medical textbooks, standardized models, medical imaging, developmental biology) that confirm the count of 206 bones in the adult human body. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
