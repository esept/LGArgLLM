Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that China's population is over 1 billion, supported by various authoritative sources (United Nations, National Bureau of Statistics of China, World Bank, government publications, academic studies). None of the justifications are disjoint; they all overlap in supporting the claim with different evidence.
