Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or aspect of double jeopardy (e.g., legal principle in the U.S. Constitution, international human rights law, conditions for application, exceptions like civil lawsuits, and the purpose of the principle). None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim in the same way.
