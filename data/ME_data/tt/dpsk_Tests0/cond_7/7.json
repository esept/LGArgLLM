Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the legal and human rights foundations of the presumption of innocence, its role in ensuring fair trials, and its protection against wrongful convictions. These overlapping themes indicate that the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
