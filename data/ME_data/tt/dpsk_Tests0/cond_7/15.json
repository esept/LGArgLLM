Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All justifications relate to the ages of Xiaoming, his father, and his grandfather forming an arithmetic sequence when Xiaoming turns 30. They share a common semantic subset that supports the claim, focusing on the specific ages and their arithmetic properties.
