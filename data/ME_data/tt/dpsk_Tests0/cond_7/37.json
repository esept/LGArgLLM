Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the biological classification and traits of cats (including tigers) as mammals. For example, the first and third justifications both refer to the biological taxonomy classifying cats as mammals, while the second and fourth justifications both mention specific mammalian traits. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
