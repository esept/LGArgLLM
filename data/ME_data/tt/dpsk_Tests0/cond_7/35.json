Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the arithmetic and logical consistency of age calculation over time. For example, the first and second justifications both rely on the arithmetic of adding 10 years to 20 to get 30, while the third and fourth justifications both refer to the standard method of age calculation. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
