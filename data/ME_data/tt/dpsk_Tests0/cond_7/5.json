Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the lack of genuine consent or voluntary agreement due to coercion, which directly supports the claim that a contract is not valid if one party was coerced into signing it. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
