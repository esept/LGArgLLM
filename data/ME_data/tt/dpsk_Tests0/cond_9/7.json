Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by emphasizing the legal and ethical importance of the presumption of innocence. They collectively highlight its foundation in human rights, its role in fair trials, its protection against unjust punishment, and its contribution to reducing wrongful convictions. This shared basis uniformly supports the claim.
