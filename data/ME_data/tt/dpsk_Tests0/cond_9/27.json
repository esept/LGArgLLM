Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 = 18 is correct due to the application of basic arithmetic rules, specifically the order of operations (parentheses first, then multiplication). Each argument reinforces this by explaining the steps (sum inside parentheses followed by multiplication) and confirming the result as 18.
