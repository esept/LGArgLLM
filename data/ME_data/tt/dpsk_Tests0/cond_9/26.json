Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by demonstrating the correctness of the equation through basic arithmetic operations (exponents and addition) and adherence to mathematical principles (order of operations, definitions of exponents and addition). Each justification independently confirms that 2² + 2² equals 8, thus collectively supporting the same semantic basis for the claim.
