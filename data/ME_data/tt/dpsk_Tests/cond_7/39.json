Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all refer to principles of logic (universal instantiation, syllogism, set theory, and deductive reasoning) that validate the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
