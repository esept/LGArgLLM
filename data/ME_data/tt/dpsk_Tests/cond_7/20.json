Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to France's adoption and use of the euro as its official currency. The justifications overlap in meaning as they all contribute to supporting the claim by detailing different aspects of France's relationship with the euro (e.g., adoption date, legal status, monetary policy oversight, and transactional use). Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
