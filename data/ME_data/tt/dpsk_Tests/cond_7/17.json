Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all revolve around the independent but complementary developments of calculus by Newton and Leibniz, their publications, the adoption of their notations, and the historical consensus on their contributions. These justifications share overlapping semantic content supporting the claim, as they all contribute to the idea that both Newton and Leibniz independently discovered calculus. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
