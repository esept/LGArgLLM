Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically with respect to the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to the classification of cats (including tigers) under the biological family Felidae, which is part of Mammalia. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both mention scientific taxonomy and mammalian characteristics. Since none of the pairs are semantically disjoint, the result is false.
