Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the claim that the human body has 206 bones. The first argument directly states the count of 206 bones, the second explains how this count is achieved from a higher number in newborns, and the third acknowledges variations but confirms the standard count. Thus, none of the pairs are semantically disjoint.
