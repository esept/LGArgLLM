Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea of transitivity in ordering relations, which is the core concept supporting the claim. Each justification either directly references the transitive property or describes a scenario where transitivity applies (e.g., in ordered sets, strict total orders, or temporal ordering). This semantic overlap exists for every pair of arguments.
