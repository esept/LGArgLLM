Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the human body has 206 bones, either by stating it directly or by explaining the process (e.g., fusion of bones in newborns) that leads to this count. The justifications overlap in their support for the claim through anatomical studies, medical consensus, and explanations of bone development.
