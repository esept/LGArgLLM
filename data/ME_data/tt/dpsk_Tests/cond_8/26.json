Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that 2² equals 4 and the sum of two 4s is 8, which directly supports the claim that the equation 2² + 2² = 8 holds true. Each argument reiterates this basic arithmetic reasoning, ensuring that every pair of arguments overlaps in their justification.
