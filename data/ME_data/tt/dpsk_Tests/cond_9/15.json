Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that the ages of Xiaoming, his father, and his grandfather form an arithmetic sequence (30, 60, 90) when Xiaoming turns 30, based on the initial conditions provided in the claim. Each justification supports this conclusion either by verifying the arithmetic progression or by confirming the mathematical consistency of the claim.
