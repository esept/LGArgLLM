Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the same semantic core, which is that the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 = 18 holds true because the operations follow the standard order of operations (parentheses first, then multiplication) and correctly compute to 18. Each argument reinforces this common basis with slightly different phrasing but identical underlying reasoning.
