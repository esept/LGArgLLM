Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. The first two arguments focus on the general relationship between cold temperatures and winter, while the third argument introduces a specific condition (meteorological date ranges) that is not mentioned or implied in the other justifications. Therefore, there is no intersection of meaning across all justifications.
