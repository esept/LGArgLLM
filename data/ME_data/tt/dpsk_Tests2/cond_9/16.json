Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that Leibniz discovered gravity. The first justification focuses on Leibniz's independent development of calculus as foundational to gravity's mathematical description, while the second justification discusses his philosophical writings on dynamics and force as contributing to gravitational concepts indirectly. Neither justification directly supports the claim that Leibniz discovered gravity, and their focuses are different (mathematical vs. philosophical contributions).
