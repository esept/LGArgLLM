Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first argument provides a direct calculation showing that the ages form an arithmetic sequence (30, 60, 90) when Xiaoming turns 30, based on the given initial conditions. The second argument supports the plausibility of the claim by assuming no gaps or inconsistencies in the generational ages, which aligns with the straightforward family structure implied by the first argument. Both justifications collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
