Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first argument ("Excessive water intake dilutes sodium levels...") and the fourth argument ("The kidneys have a limited capacity...") both discuss the physiological mechanism by which excessive water intake leads to hyponatremia. Similarly, the second argument ("Athletes and endurance runners...") and the third argument ("Medical case studies...") both provide specific examples or contexts where excessive water intake leads to hyponatremia. However, since the question asks whether at least one pair is disjoint, we can consider pairs like the first and fifth arguments, where the first discusses the general mechanism and the fifth discusses the symptoms, which are semantically distinct aspects of the claim. Thus, there exists at least one pair of arguments with disjoint justifications.
