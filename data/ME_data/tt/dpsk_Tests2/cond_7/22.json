Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both mention that Earth orbits the Sun, which is a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both reference scientific consensus and observations, which overlap in meaning. Therefore, there are pairs of arguments whose justifications share common semantic subsets.
