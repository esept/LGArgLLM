Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the obscurity or inaccessibility of the law, while the second argument discusses reliance on an official interpretation. These are distinct reasons supporting the claim, with no overlap in meaning.
