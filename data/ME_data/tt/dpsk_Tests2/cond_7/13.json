Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the factual ancestry of Donald Trump's grandfather, while the second justification centers on Donald Trump's public acknowledgment of his German ancestry. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
