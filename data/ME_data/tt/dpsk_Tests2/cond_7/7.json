Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the principle being a fundamental tenet of legal systems, the second on the protection of individuals from unjust consequences, and the third on historical abuses. While all support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping justifications.
