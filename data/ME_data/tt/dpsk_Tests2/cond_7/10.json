Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments are related to the claim that "The capital of France is Paris" and overlap in their semantic content. For example, the first argument mentions historical records and governmental institutions, the second mentions political and administrative functions, and the third mentions international recognition. These justifications all contribute to the same overarching support for the claim and are not semantically disjoint.
