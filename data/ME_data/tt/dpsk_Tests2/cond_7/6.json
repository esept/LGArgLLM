Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or context (retroactive application in some jurisdictions, international tribunals, and universally morally wrong acts) under which a person can be punished for an act that was legal when committed. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
