Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both reference the independent development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz in different decades, which is a common semantic subset supporting the claim. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both discuss the distinct but significant contributions of Newton and Leibniz, overlapping in their support for the joint discovery claim. Since there are overlapping semantic subsets among the justifications, the result is true.
