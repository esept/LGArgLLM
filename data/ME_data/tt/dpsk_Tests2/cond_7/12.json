Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments provide different but related reasons supporting the claim that Donald Trump is an American (birth in the U.S., citizenship and presidency, and lack of disputes about nationality). Since they all contribute to the same claim in overlapping ways, none of the pairs are disjoint.
