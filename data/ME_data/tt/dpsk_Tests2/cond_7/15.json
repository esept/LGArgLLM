Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both arguments support the claim by explaining how the ages form an arithmetic sequence when Xiaoming turns 30. The first argument provides a detailed calculation showing the ages 30, 60, and 90, while the second argument supports the plausibility of the claim by assuming no gaps in generational ages. Both justifications contribute to the same conclusion about the arithmetic sequence, hence they are not disjoint.
