Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on medical imaging and cadaver studies confirming the count for adults, while the second argument discusses the fusion of bones from infants to adults. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that supports the claim.
