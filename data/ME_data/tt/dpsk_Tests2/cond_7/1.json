Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all arguments share a common semantic subset related to insulin's role in lowering blood sugar levels. The first argument explains the mechanism (uptake of glucose into cells), the second provides clinical evidence, and the third discusses its therapeutic use in diabetes. All justifications contribute to supporting the claim by addressing different aspects of the same core idea.
