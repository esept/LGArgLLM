Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all explain how the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 simplifies to 18 using different mathematical principles (simplification, order of operations, distributive property). Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
