Result: true
Justification: The two arguments provided have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on Leibniz's independent development of calculus and its foundational role in describing gravity, while the second justification discusses his philosophical writings on dynamics and force, which are more abstract and not directly related to the discovery of gravity. There is no overlap in the semantic content of these justifications in supporting the claim.
