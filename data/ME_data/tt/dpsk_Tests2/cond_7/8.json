Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, the second mentions the global recognition of the principle, and the third focuses on the finality of legal proceedings. Each justification provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
