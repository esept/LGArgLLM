Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly states that the euro is the official currency of France, provides legal or institutional confirmation (e.g., Banque de France, French law), or mentions the practical usage of the euro (e.g., prices, transactions). These justifications consistently reinforce the same core idea that the euro is France's official currency, with no contradictory or divergent reasoning.
