```
Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the same semantic justification that the equation 2² + 2² equals 8 is correct based on basic arithmetic operations (exponentiation and addition). Each argument confirms the correctness of the equation by breaking down the calculation steps (2² = 4, 4 + 4 = 8), thus overlapping in their reasoning.
