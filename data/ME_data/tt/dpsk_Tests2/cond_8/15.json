Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the same core reasoning about the ages of Xiaoming, his father, and his grandfather forming an arithmetic sequence when Xiaoming turns 30. The first argument explicitly calculates the ages (30, 60, 90) and shows they form an arithmetic sequence, while the second argument supports the plausibility of this scenario by assuming no gaps or inconsistencies in generational ages. Both justifications revolve around the same mathematical and logical structure supporting the claim.
