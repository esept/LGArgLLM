Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on Leibniz's independent development of calculus and its foundational role in the mathematical description of gravity, while the second argument discusses his philosophical writings on dynamics and force as contributing to a broader understanding of gravitational concepts. These justifications address different aspects of Leibniz's work and do not intersect in their reasoning or propositions supporting the claim.
