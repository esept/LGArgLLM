Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument discusses retroactive application of procedural or interpretive laws, the second focuses on international tribunals prosecuting acts legal under domestic law but violating international norms, and the third mentions retroactive punishment for acts universally considered morally wrong. These are distinct justifications without semantic overlap.
