Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic justification related to the count of bones in the human body, albeit at different stages of life (adults vs. infants). The first argument directly states the count of 206 bones in adults, while the second explains how infants start with more bones that fuse to reach the same count of 206 in adulthood. Both justifications support the claim by addressing the number of bones in the human body.
