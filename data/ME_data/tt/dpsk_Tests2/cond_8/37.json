Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that tigers are mammals due to their classification within the cat family (Felidae) and their possession of mammalian traits. The first argument states that tigers are mammals by definition as members of the cat family, the second confirms this through biological classification, and the third supports it by listing mammalian traits of tigers. Thus, all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
