Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument emphasizes the fundamental legal tenet, the second focuses on protection of human rights, and the third highlights historical abuses. While each argument has a distinct focus, they all intersect on the idea that the presumption of innocence is necessary to prevent unjust treatment, which is central to the claim.
