Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references the legal principle of double jeopardy, its purpose (e.g., preventing government overreach, ensuring finality), and its protection against repeated prosecutions. The justifications consistently support the claim by reinforcing the idea that double jeopardy prevents a person from being tried twice for the same crime.
