Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that insulin facilitates the reduction of blood sugar levels, either through physiological mechanisms (e.g., glucose uptake into cells) or clinical evidence (e.g., studies and standard therapy for diabetes). The justifications consistently support the claim by overlapping in their core reasoning about insulin's role in lowering blood sugar.
