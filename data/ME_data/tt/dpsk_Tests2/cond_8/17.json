Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the independent development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz, supported by historical records, publications, and their distinct contributions. The common theme across all justifications is the independent yet simultaneous discovery by both mathematicians, reinforcing the claim of joint discovery.
