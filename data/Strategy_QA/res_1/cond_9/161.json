Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications provided share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They collectively emphasize that Aldi operates under a single corporate entity (Aldi US), follows uniform branding and operational standards, has a unified corporate structure, and is confirmed by public records as the sole legal owner of all U.S. locations. This consistent theme across all arguments confirms a shared semantic basis for the claim.
