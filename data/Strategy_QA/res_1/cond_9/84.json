Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share the common semantic core that the Chinese zodiac includes multiple quadrupeds (Dog, Pig, Ox, Sheep/Goat, Horse, Tiger) as part of its 12-year cycle. Each justification reinforces the representation of quadrupeds on the Chinese calendar, providing a consistent and overlapping basis for the claim.
