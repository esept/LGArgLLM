Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that directly supports the claim. While they mention EA's publishing history, collaborations with Nintendo, and potential revenue-sharing arrangements, none of them explicitly confirm that EA profited from Metroid sales. The arguments are speculative and do not intersect on a specific, shared basis for the claim.
