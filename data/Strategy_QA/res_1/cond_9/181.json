Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications collectively emphasize Curiosity's technical capabilities (drill, sample-handling system, onboard instruments) and mission objectives (exploring scientifically interesting regions like Lacus Temporis) to gather and analyze rock samples. This consistent focus on the rover's design, functionality, and mission goals forms a shared basis for the claim.
