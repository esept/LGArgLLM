Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently emphasize that the French Defense is a well-known, classical, and standard chess opening that is widely studied, taught, and included in professional training, databases, and FIDE curriculum for grandmasters. This shared basis collectively supports the claim that most grandmasters know the French Defense.
