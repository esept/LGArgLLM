Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of all P-type arguments collectively do not support the same semantic basis for the claim. While each argument individually provides reasons why a B-52 would be more effective than a bald eagle in delivering an urgent message, they focus on different aspects (e.g., communication systems, deployment precision, weather conditions, track record, and controllability). There is no single shared semantic core that all justifications intersect on to support the claim.
