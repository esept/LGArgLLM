Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided focus on different aspects of grief being observable (visible behaviors, cultural norms, physical symptoms), but they do not share a single, common semantic core that applies universally to all instances of grief. Each justification highlights a different way grief might be obvious, but none alone or in combination cover all possible cases, implying that grief is not always obvious in every context.
