Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. While both arguments correctly point out that Old English was not spoken during the time of the Confederate States, they do so by referencing different historical and linguistic facts (one mentions the timeframe of Old English, the other mentions its evolution into Middle English). There is no single shared semantic basis across both justifications.
