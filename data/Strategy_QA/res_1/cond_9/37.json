Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, all arguments uniformly contradict the claim by stating that the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs in December, not closer to July. There is no intersection of justifications that supports the claim's correctness.
