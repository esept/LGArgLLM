Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by focusing on the stadium's seating capacity (16,000) in relation to Gothenburg's population (~600,000), its design, location, historical attendance, and comparisons to similar venues. Each argument reinforces the idea that the stadium can accommodate a tenth of the city's population.
