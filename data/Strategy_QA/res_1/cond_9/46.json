```
Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument states that months are based on lunar cycles, contradicting the claim, while the second argument states that months in the Gregorian calendar are arbitrary divisions, also not supporting the claim. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
