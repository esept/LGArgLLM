Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification contradicts the claim by stating that Mary's bloodline continued through James I, while the second justification states there is no evidence the conspirators targeted Mary's descendants. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
