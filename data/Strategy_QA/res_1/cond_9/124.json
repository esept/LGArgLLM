Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. Some argue that a coat is necessary due to extreme cold and lack of atmosphere (e.g., -40Â°C temperature, no insulation), while others suggest conditions where a coat might not be needed (e.g., controlled environment, short-term exposure, low gravity reducing bulk). The arguments present conflicting scenarios rather than a unified basis for the claim.
