Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that twins are born within a very short time frame (minutes or hours, same 24-hour period, near-simultaneous delivery, single continuous event, short interval), which ensures they are born in the same year. There is no contradiction or divergence in the justifications; all support the claim uniformly.
