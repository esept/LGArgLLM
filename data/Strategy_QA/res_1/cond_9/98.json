Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments (e.g., the first and third) suggest the War Doctor had significant screen time or narrative weight, while others (e.g., the second and fourth) explicitly state the Twelfth Doctor had far more screen time. These justifications contradict each other rather than intersecting on a shared basis for the claim.
