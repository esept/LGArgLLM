Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share the common semantic core that the giant panda's black-and-white coloration differs from the yin yang symbol in terms of pattern, distribution, symmetry, and purpose. Each justification highlights a distinct aspect of this difference (e.g., irregular patches vs. symmetry, functional vs. symbolic purpose), but all converge on the claim's central idea.
