Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments depict Hades as a distant or passive ruler (e.g., allowing free movement, rarely intervening), while others emphasize his strict enforcement of rules and systematic control (e.g., preventing souls from leaving, guarded gates). These are contradictory interpretations of Hades' grip on the Underworld.
