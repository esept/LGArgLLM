Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on Pollock's struggle with alcoholism, while the second argument points out the anachronistic nature of associating him with the straight edge movement. These justifications address different aspects and do not intersect semantically.
