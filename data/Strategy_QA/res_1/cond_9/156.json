Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification states that sesame seeds are adhered using egg wash or water, while the second mentions edible binding agents like sugar syrup or starch-based solutions. Both justifications contradict the claim by stating that glue is not used, rather than supporting it.
