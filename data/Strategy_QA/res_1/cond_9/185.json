Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first and third justifications focus on the lack of scientific evidence and guidelines for quartz in Internal Medicine, while the second justification states that quartz is not listed in homeopathic pharmacopeias. There is no overlap in meaning that collectively supports the claim about Homeopathy doctors being more likely to recommend quartz.
