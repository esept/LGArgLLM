Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by highlighting the differences in collection size, storage methods, and physical infrastructure between the Library of Alexandria and the Library of Congress. Each justification emphasizes that the Library of Congress has a larger and more diverse collection, requires more space per item, and occupies more physical space overall, which collectively substantiates the claim that the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space.
