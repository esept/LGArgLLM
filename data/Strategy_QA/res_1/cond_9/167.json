Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they all argue against the claim by stating that biochemistry does not study gluons, focusing on different aspects (scope of molecules, academic curricula, and research publications) to refute the claim. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
