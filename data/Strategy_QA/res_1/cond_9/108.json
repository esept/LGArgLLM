Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. While most arguments highlight greed's prevalence in economic and social contexts (e.g., economic inequality, corporate scandals, consumer culture, pursuit of wealth), one argument (about lust and gluttony being more visibly prevalent) contradicts the claim and diverges from the shared focus on greed. Thus, there is no intersection across all justifications.
