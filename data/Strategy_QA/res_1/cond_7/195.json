Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first and third arguments focus on Mario (red and blue outfit) as the primary focus, while the second argument focuses on Luigi (green outfit) in specific titles. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications regarding the claim.
