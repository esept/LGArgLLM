Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in meaning as they all contribute to supporting the claim that Bill Gates is the wealthiest of the Baby Boomers by citing his net worth, the success of Microsoft, his ranking on wealth indices, his diversified investments, and his continued wealth growth despite philanthropy. Since none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false. However, the task asks to return True if at least one pair is disjoint, which is not the case here, so the correct result is False. But based on the given arguments, all justifications are related, so the correct output should be:

```
Result: false
Justification: All justifications overlap in meaning as they all support the claim by citing various aspects of Bill Gates' wealth and its sources, with no pair being semantically disjoint.
