Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim because each argument cites a different space mission (Apollo 1, Challenger, Columbia, Soyuz 11, Vostok) with fatalities, contrasting them with Apollo 13's zero fatalities. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications; each provides a distinct example supporting the claim.
