Result: true
Justification: The justifications for each argument are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim because each argument cites a different mythical creature (e.g., Eris, Ceres, Vesta, Pluto, Pallas, Juno) and a different Small Solar System body. There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications; each one uniquely supports the claim by providing a distinct example.
