Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the controversial nature of Nobel's works like 'Nemesis' and their censorship, while another argues that there is no widely documented evidence of any official bans. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
