Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the thematic and stylistic differences between Kurt Sutter's work and Disney's adaptations. The second argument acknowledges the possibility of indirect involvement of Sutter's collaborators in unrelated capacities. The third argument emphasizes the improbability of involvement due to the contrasting creative focuses. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
