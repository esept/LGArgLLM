Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim: the ship's capacity, its logistical capabilities, its infrastructure, and historical precedents. None of these justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
