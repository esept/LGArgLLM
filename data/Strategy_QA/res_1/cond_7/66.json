Result: false
Justification: All three arguments share a common semantic subset related to Christopher Columbus being an Italian explorer who named Caribbean islands, including Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The justifications overlap in meaning and contribute to the claim in a similar way, so no pair is disjoint.
