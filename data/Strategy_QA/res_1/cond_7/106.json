Result: true
Justification: The two arguments provided are not semantically disjoint, as both justifications focus on Jon Jones's advanced skills and training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which directly oppose the claim. Since the task requires at least one pair of arguments to be disjoint to return True, but here the arguments overlap in meaning, the result is False. However, since the question asks whether at least one pair is disjoint, and there are no disjoint pairs, the correct answer is False. But given the phrasing of the task, it seems the correct output should be False, but the initial instruction was to return True if at least one pair is disjoint. Here, no pairs are disjoint, so the correct answer is False.
