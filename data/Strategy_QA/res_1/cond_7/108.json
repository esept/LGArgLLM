Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on economic inequality, another on corporate scandals, and another on consumer culture. While all support the claim that greed is prevalent, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping justifications (e.g., economic inequality vs. consumer culture). Additionally, one argument even contrasts greed with other sins like lust and gluttony, further demonstrating semantic disjointness.
