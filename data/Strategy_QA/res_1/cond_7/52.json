Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the fictional nature of Lannisters and their inability to interact with real-world objects, while the second justification emphasizes the laws of physics and biology preventing inanimate objects from affecting fictional beings. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
