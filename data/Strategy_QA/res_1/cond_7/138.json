Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the dangers of consuming chlorine and sodium, such as toxicity, health risks, and regulatory classifications. For example, multiple arguments mention the toxicity of chlorine and sodium (e.g., "Chlorine gas is toxic" and "can lead to chemical burns or poisoning") and the health risks (e.g., "respiratory damage" and "cellular damage"). Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
