Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all share a common semantic subset related to how rivers contributed to the rise of agriculture (e.g., fertile soil, irrigation, nutrient-rich silt, transportation, historical evidence). Since none of the pairs of arguments have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false.
