Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first argument mentions the budget and gross earnings, while the third argument also references the box office performance, which overlaps in discussing the financial success of the film. Similarly, the second and fourth arguments both touch on the film's commercial success and cultural impact, indicating some semantic overlap. However, the fifth argument introduces a new aspect (soundtrack contributing to profitability) that is not covered by the others, making at least one pair (e.g., A1 and A5) disjoint in their justifications with respect to the claim.
