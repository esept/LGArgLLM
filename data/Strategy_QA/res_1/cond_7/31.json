Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common theme of comparing the entry requirements and processes of the University of Pittsburgh and the FBI, but each argument focuses on a different aspect (e.g., acceptance rates, background checks, eligibility criteria, admission pathways). Therefore, they overlap in their contribution to supporting the claim.
