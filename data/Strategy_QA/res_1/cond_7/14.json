Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., coastline diversity, warm climate, tourist infrastructure, and calm lagoons), and none of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
