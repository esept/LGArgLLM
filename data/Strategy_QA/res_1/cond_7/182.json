Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument highlights a different aspect of Robert Downey Jr.'s life (e.g., overcoming addiction, career rebuilding, philanthropy, acting roles, family life, mental health advocacy) that contributes to him being a good role model. There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications that directly supports the claim.
