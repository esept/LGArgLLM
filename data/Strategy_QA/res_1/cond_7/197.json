Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the alienation of the traditional fanbase due to the image change, while another argues that sales were driven more by music than appearance. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
