Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the numerical impossibility (7 dwarfs vs. minimum 3 players per game), while the second argument addresses the practical constraints (complexity and time requirements of the game vs. dwarfs' work schedules). There is no overlap in their reasoning with respect to the claim.
