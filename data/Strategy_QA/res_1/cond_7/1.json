Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint in some cases. For example, the first argument focuses on the widespread availability of JPEG in the 1990s and the group's use of computers, while the third argument discusses the group's focus on religious content, which does not overlap with the technical capabilities mentioned in the first argument. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
