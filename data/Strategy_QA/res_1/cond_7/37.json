Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all point out that the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs in December, not closer to July, and they reference astronomical facts like axial tilt and seasonal dates. While they overlap in meaning by correcting the claim, they are not semantically disjoint as they all contribute to the same correction. However, the first argument mentions the solstice is closer to January than July, which introduces a slightly different point (comparison to January), making it partially disjoint from the others that focus on December vs. July. Thus, at least one pair (e.g., first argument vs. others) is semantically disjoint.
