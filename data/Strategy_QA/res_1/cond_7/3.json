Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic theme related to the cold weather in New York during February (Groundhog Day) and the necessity or likelihood of children wearing jackets. There is significant overlap in meaning, as all arguments support the claim by referencing cold temperatures, school policies, parental behavior, or public health advisories, all of which contribute to the same conclusion. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
