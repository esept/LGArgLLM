Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments cover distinct aspects of the claim, such as high medical costs (A1), ongoing medical expenses (A2), insurance coverage (A3), lost income (A4), social safety nets (A5), and complications (A6). These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, making them semantically disjoint.
