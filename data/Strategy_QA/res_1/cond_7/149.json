Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. All three arguments discuss the effectiveness and safety of ammonia-based cleaners in the context of pet ownership, with shared themes of odor neutralization and suitability for pet-related messes. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
