Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., Mount Everest's prominence, adaptive optics, occasional terrestrial use, and clear skies in the Atacama Desert) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
