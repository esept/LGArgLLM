Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct example or genre where radioactive waste is used as a plot device, without overlapping in meaning or shared semantic subsets. For instance, one argument discusses science fiction and thrillers, another post-apocalyptic shows, another superhero narratives, and so on. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim beyond the general idea that radioactive waste is used as a plot device in various contexts.
