Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to Pan's role as a deity relevant to shepherds and the cultural context of praying to Pan for protection and other related aspects. Each justification builds on the others to support the claim, so there is overlap in their semantic content.
