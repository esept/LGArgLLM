Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the absorbency and practicality of tampons for extended use, supporting the claim. The first argument mentions efficient absorption for light to moderate flow, while the second highlights highly absorbent materials for extended use. These justifications overlap in their support of the claim, so they are not semantically disjoint.
