Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on commercially available pet carriers for small primates, while the second argument discusses the use of backpacks by wildlife rescue organizations for transporting injured or orphaned primates. These justifications address different contexts (commercial vs. rescue) and do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
