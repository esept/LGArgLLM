Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument discusses the use of biochemistry in biogeography for studying soil composition and its impact on plant and animal distributions, while the second argument focuses on environmental geographers using biochemistry to analyze pollutants and their effects on ecosystems. These justifications address different applications of biochemistry in geography without overlapping in their semantic content.
