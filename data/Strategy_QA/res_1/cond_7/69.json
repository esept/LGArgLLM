Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to how anorexia nervosa negatively impacts bone health, leading to a higher likelihood of fractures. While each argument highlights a different mechanism (e.g., malnutrition, low body weight, hormonal imbalances, osteoporosis, nutrient deprivation, reduced muscle mass), they all contribute to the same overarching idea that anorexia increases fracture risk. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
