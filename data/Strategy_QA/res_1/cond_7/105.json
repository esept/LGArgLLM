Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to the claim that most grandmasters know the French Defense. They all revolve around the idea that the French Defense is a well-known, classical opening that is studied, taught, and played at the highest levels of chess, and thus grandmasters are expected to be familiar with it. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
