Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on religious principles (haram), another on the image of strength, another on survival justification, another on cultural norms, another on public perception, and another on subjective moral judgment. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim in the same way.
