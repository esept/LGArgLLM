Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the low temperature requiring a coat, another on the lack of atmosphere necessitating thermal protection, and another on the potential for a controlled environment making a coat unnecessary. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in their semantic contributions.
