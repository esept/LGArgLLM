Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share overlapping semantic content related to the themes of substance abuse and dysfunctional family dynamics in 'Rick and Morty' and their potential impact on children of alcoholics. For example, arguments about Rick's behavior and family relationships overlap in discussing triggering elements. However, there is at least one pair (e.g., the second and fifth arguments) that introduces a disjoint perspective by suggesting that the show's fantastical nature or viewers' coping mechanisms might prevent triggering, which does not overlap with the other justifications.
