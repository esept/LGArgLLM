Result: false
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic subset of "quadrupeds being part of the Chinese zodiac calendar." Each justification refers to a different quadruped (Dog, Pig, Ox, Sheep/Goat, Horse, Tiger) but all support the claim in the same way by listing examples of quadrupeds in the zodiac. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
