Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on EA's general publishing and distribution of games, the second on EA's past collaborations with Nintendo, and the third on EA's partnerships and licensing deals. While all support the claim, they do so through distinct and non-overlapping lines of reasoning. Thus, at least one pair of justifications is disjoint.
