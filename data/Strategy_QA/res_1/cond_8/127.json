Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (runtime comparison, release date discrepancy, temporal overlap impossibility, and general duration likelihood) without overlapping semantic content in their justifications. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share semantic intersections.
