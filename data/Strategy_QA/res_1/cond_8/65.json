Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the Catholic Church's requirements for the pope (e.g., being a practicing Catholic, affirming Church doctrines, being a member of the clergy) are incompatible with agnosticism. Each argument reinforces this core idea from different angles (doctrinal, canonical, electoral), ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
