```
Result: false
Justification: Not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about universal healthcare systems reducing bankruptcy risk does not share a common idea with the argument about lost income due to recovery time. Similarly, the argument about medical bankruptcy being rare in developed nations does not overlap with the argument about high medical costs of the surgery itself. Therefore, not all pairs have semantic intersections.
