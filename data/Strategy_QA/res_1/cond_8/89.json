Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The arguments collectively focus on the VLT's capabilities (adaptive optics, clear skies in the Atacama Desert) and the feasibility of observing Mount Everest (prominent feature, terrestrial observation for calibration). Each pair intersects on at least one of these ideas, ensuring semantic overlap.
