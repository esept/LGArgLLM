Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the Bactrian camel is unique or impressive due to having two humps, which is the central idea supporting the claim. Each argument either directly states this uniqueness, explains the functional advantage of the two humps, or compares it to other species lacking this feature. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their support for the claim.
