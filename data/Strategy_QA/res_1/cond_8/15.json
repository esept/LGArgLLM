Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses Ada Lovelace's death at age 36, which was below the average life expectancy for her era, and highlights the tragic nature of her early death due to illness, limited medical advancements, or the loss of her potential contributions. These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments intersects semantically.
