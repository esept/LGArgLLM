Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea or reasoning pattern. For example, the second argument contrasts Marilyn Manson's harsh singing style with soul music's smooth vocal tone, which does not overlap with the other arguments that focus on his vocal versatility, dramatic expression, or ability to transition genres. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
