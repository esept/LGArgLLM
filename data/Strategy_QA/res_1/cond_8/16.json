Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly references the seating capacity of the Toyota Stadium in relation to Gothenburg's population (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) or supports this idea by discussing the stadium's design, location, historical attendance, or comparison to other venues. The common theme across all justifications is the relationship between the stadium's capacity and the city's population, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
