Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that HIV cannot be transmitted through sharing silverware, either because the virus is not present in saliva, cannot survive outside the body, or is not transmitted through casual contact. Each justification overlaps with at least one other in supporting the claim that sharing silverware with an HIV-positive person is safe.
