Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the temporal proximity of twin births (e.g., "within minutes or hours," "same 24-hour period," "near-simultaneous delivery," "single continuous event," "short interval between births"), which directly supports the claim that twins are always born during the same year. The justifications also consistently reference biological, medical, or statistical evidence to reinforce this idea. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects on the core reasoning that twins cannot be born in different years due to the nature of their birth process.
