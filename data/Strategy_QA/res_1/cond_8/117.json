Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping justifications (e.g., A1, A3, and A5 all mention English being widely available or understood), not all pairs share a common idea. For example, A2 focuses on familiarity with Disney parks' layout, which does not overlap with A4's focus on cultural differences in park operations. Similarly, A4's emphasis on cultural differences does not intersect with A5's focus on English being commonly understood. Thus, not all pairs share semantic intersections in their justifications.
