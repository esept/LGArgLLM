Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that Old English was spoken long before the Confederate States existed, while the second argument states that Old English had evolved into Middle English by the 15th century. Although both arguments refute the claim, they do so based on different historical and linguistic points, without a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
