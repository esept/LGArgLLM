Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument revolves around the idea that the legal and geographical separation between San Antonio (U.S.) and the UK's electoral system makes it impossible for San Antonio citizens to vote for Boris Johnson. The justifications consistently highlight the absence of a legal mechanism, the restriction of voting to UK residents, and the separation of electoral systems, which are common themes across all arguments.
