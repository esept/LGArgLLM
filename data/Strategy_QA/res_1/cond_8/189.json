Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications. The first argument focuses on the submission process and Cheb Mami's career trajectory, while the second argument discusses the background and training of past winners. There is no semantic overlap between these justifications in relation to the claim.
