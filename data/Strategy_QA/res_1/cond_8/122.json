Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument highlights a different aspect of how a diet of ice would lead to fatal consequences, such as malnutrition, energy depletion, hypothermia, digestive complications, and electrolyte imbalances. These aspects collectively support the claim by detailing various physiological deficiencies and harms caused by consuming only ice.
