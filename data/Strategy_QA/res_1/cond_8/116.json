Result: false
Justification: Not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument "Children of alcoholics may not necessarily be triggered by 'Rick and Morty' as the show's fantastical and exaggerated nature could distance it from real-life experiences" does not share a common idea with "The character of Rick Sanchez exhibits behaviors associated with alcoholism, such as excessive drinking and erratic behavior, which could be triggering for those with similar family experiences." The former argues that the show's nature distances it from real-life triggers, while the latter focuses on specific behaviors of a character that could be triggering.
