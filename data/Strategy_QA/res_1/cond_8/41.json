Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the small size of newborn American Black Bear cubs and/or the dimensions of a king-size bed, which are central to the claim that two cubs could fit on such a bed. The justifications consistently support the claim by referencing the cubs' size, the bed's dimensions, or both, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
