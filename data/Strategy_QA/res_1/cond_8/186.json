Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on the absence of gluten in potato vodka due to its ingredients (potatoes), the distillation process, or certification/medical guidelines, all of which support the claim that someone with celiac disease can safely consume potato vodka. The common theme across all justifications is the safety of potato vodka for celiac patients because it is gluten-free.
