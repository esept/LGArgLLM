Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on genetic diversity and ancestry as a reason for Sara Paxton being considered Latino, while the second argument discusses cultural contributions or roles as a basis for Latino identity. These justifications address different aspects (genetic vs. cultural) and do not intersect in meaning.
