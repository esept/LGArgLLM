Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that bodies exhibit movement during hanging due to various physiological and physical mechanisms. Each pair of arguments overlaps in their reasoning about involuntary muscle contractions, reflexes, or physical forces (like gravity and rope tension) causing observable motion. Additionally, the reference to historical and forensic records ties all arguments together by providing empirical support for the claim. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
