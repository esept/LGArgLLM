Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The first argument discusses the effectiveness of ammonia-based cleaners for organic stains and odors common in pet households. The second argument adds that these cleaners are safe for pets when used as directed, which relates to the first argument's focus on pet-related messes. The third argument reinforces the idea by mentioning ammonia's role in neutralizing strong odors from pet-related messes like urine. Thus, all arguments intersect on the idea that ammonia-based cleaners are effective and safe for pet-related cleaning needs.
