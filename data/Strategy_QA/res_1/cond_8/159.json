Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument compares the Library of Alexandria and the Library of Congress in terms of collection size, storage methods, or physical infrastructure, reinforcing the idea that the Library of Alexandria would require less shelf space. For example, arguments about scroll storage vs. modern formats (A2) and multimedia collections (A3) both implicitly or explicitly reference the difference in storage needs, while arguments about collection size (A1) and physical infrastructure (A5) directly support the claim through quantitative comparisons. Thus, all pairs intersect semantically in supporting the claim.
