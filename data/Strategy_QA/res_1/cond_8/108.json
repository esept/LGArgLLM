Result: false
Justification: The arguments generally support the claim that greed is prevalent, but the justification for the argument about lust and gluttony ("Lust and gluttony are more immediately observable in daily human behavior, making them more visibly prevalent than greed") does not overlap semantically with the justifications of the other arguments. This argument contrasts greed with other sins rather than reinforcing its prevalence, creating a lack of semantic intersection with the other justifications.
