Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first and third arguments focus on the thematic and stylistic differences between Kurt Sutter's work and Disney's adaptations, while the second argument introduces the possibility of indirect involvement of Sutter's collaborators in unrelated capacities. There is no semantic overlap in their justifications.
