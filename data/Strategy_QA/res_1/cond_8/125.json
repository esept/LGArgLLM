Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the shared habitats or overlapping regions (North Atlantic Ocean, pelagic zones) where grey seals and sperm whales (the subject of 'Moby Dick') coexist. Additionally, they all reference biological or historical evidence supporting the possibility of shared waters, such as marine biologists' confirmation or historical whaling records. The consistency in themes (habitat overlap, cohabitation evidence) ensures that every pair of arguments intersects semantically.
