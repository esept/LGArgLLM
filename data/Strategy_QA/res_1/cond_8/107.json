Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first argument focuses on Conan's disadvantage due to technology and teamwork, while the second argument highlights his potential to adapt due to physical prowess. These justifications do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
