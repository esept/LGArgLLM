Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument highlights different aspects of the comparison between the University of Pittsburgh's admission process and the FBI's hiring process, such as acceptance rates, required qualifications, and eligibility criteria. These aspects collectively support the claim that the University of Pittsburgh is easier to enter than the FBI.
