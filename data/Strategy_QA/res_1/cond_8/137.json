Result: false
Justification: The first two arguments and the fourth argument share semantic overlap in their justifications, as they all discuss the use of biochemistry in studying environmental or ecological processes (soils, pollutants, carbon cycles). However, the third argument does not share this overlap, as it focuses on traditional geographic work that does not require biochemistry. Thus, not all pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications.
