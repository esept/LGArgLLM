Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the anatomical heart and the symbolic heart differ in appearance, with each argument providing specific details (e.g., structural complexity, symmetry, historical depictions, medical illustrations, usage contexts) that collectively reinforce this claim. The semantic overlap lies in the consistent emphasis on the visual dissimilarity between the two types of hearts.
