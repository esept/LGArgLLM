Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share a common semantic intersection in their justifications. For example, the argument about religious principles (A1) does not overlap with the argument about survival needs overriding cultural norms (A4). Similarly, the argument about public perception (A5) does not share a common idea with the argument about the subjective nature of moral judgment (A6). Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
