Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The common idea is that members of Cosmic Girls have shown interest in or have been known to engage in gaming activities, which supports the plausibility that they could play League of Legends alone. Each argument reinforces this idea through different perspectives (general hobbies of K-pop idols, popularity of the game, and specific mentions by members), ensuring semantic overlap.
