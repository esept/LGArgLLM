Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first and second arguments both mention Venus as the densest terrestrial planet and its association with Friday. The first and third arguments both mention Venus's traditional astrological associations (with Friday and with love/beauty, respectively). The second and third arguments both highlight Venus's prominence (brightness and thematic relevance) in astrological contexts. Thus, every pair has at least one common idea supporting the claim.
