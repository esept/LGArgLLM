Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that Pan is a relevant deity for the shepherd boy in the fable, either through his role as the god of shepherds and flocks, the cultural practice of praying to Pan for protection, or the metaphorical connections to the boy's actions and the villagers' reactions. Each pair of arguments overlaps in their justifications by focusing on Pan's relevance to the boy's situation.
