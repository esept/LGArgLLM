Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains semantic elements that align with the S-type arguments, which provide minimal semantic support for the claim. Specifically, the S-type arguments clarify that biochemistry does not study gluons, as they are subatomic particles unrelated to biological chemistry, and this is reflected in the justifications of the P-type arguments. Thus, for every minimal semantic basis of the claim (provided by the S-type arguments), there exists a P-type argument whose justification contains that basis.
