Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that suggest Italian explorers, particularly Columbus, named the islands, but the S-type arguments contradict this by indicating Spanish influence and lack of definitive evidence linking the name to an Italian explorer. There is no P-type argument whose justification contains the minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments, which challenge the claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
