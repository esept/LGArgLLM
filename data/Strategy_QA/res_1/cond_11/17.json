Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that individually refute the claim by comparing the weight or pressure of 10 gallons of seawater to the resilience of a child's body, but none of their justifications semantically contain the minimal support arguments (S-type), which focus on force distribution and buoyancy reducing pressure. Since the P arguments do not subsume the S arguments' reasoning, C11 is not satisfied.
