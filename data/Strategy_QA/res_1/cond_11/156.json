Result: true  
Justification: Both P-type arguments provide justifications that are semantically supported by the S-type arguments. The S-type arguments about food safety regulations and standardized processes in the food industry are subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications regarding the use of edible binding agents and the absence of glue. This satisfies C11 as each minimal semantic basis (food safety and standardization) is covered by the P-type arguments.
