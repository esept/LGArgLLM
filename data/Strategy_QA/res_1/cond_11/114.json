Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide evidence that frogs exhibit behaviors consistent with a basic form of disgust, such as avoidance and rejection of certain stimuli. However, the S-type arguments challenge the claim by pointing out the lack of neural structures, behavioral complexity, and cultural influences necessary for the emotion of disgust. Since the S-type arguments provide a semantic basis that contradicts the claim and is not contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments, C11 is not satisfied.
