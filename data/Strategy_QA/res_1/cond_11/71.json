Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim by calculating the feasibility of uploading 1000GB in a fortnight based on different speed scenarios. However, the S-type arguments introduce considerations like real-world speed limitations, data caps, and ISP policies that are not addressed or contradicted by the P-type justifications. These S-type arguments present minimal semantic bases that are not contained within the P-type justifications, thus failing to satisfy C11.
