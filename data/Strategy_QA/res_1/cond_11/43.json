Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on Venus being associated with Friday, its brightness, and its thematic relevance to love and beauty, but none of their justifications contain the semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, which question the relevance of a planet's density to astrological focus. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
