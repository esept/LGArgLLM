Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide plausible reasons why Cosmic Girls could play League of Legends alone, but none of their justifications contain the minimal semantic support sets provided by the S-type arguments. The S-type arguments directly challenge the claim by pointing out the lack of evidence and the impracticality due to their busy schedules, which are not addressed or refuted by the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
