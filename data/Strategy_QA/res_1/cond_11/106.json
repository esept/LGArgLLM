Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide comprehensive justifications that encompass the minimal semantic support sets from the S-type arguments. For example, the P-type argument about Jon Jones' black belt proficiency and superior grappling skills includes the S-type arguments about the skill gap between belts and the dominance of higher belts. Similarly, the P-type argument about Jones' MMA training and demonstrated skills includes the S-type arguments about his physical attributes and the improbability of a white belt defeating him. Thus, every minimal semantic basis of the claim is covered by the P-type arguments' justifications.
