Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that cover the minimal semantic bases for the claim. The first P-type argument addresses the lack of a monarchy or nobility system in the U.S., which is supported by the S-type argument about knighthoods being granted by monarchies. The second P-type argument cites the U.S. Constitution's prohibition of titles of nobility, which is supported by the S-type argument about honorary knighthoods not being official within the U.S. framework. Thus, all minimal semantic bases are covered by the P-type arguments.
