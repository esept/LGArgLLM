Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications based on Cyndi Lauper's advocacy for animal rights and her public platform, suggesting she might use milk substitutes. However, the S-type arguments present justifications that are not semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications; instead, they provide counterpoints based on lack of evidence or traditional preferences. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied as there is no P-type argument whose justification contains the minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments.
