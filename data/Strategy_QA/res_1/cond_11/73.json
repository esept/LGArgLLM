Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide evidence against the claim (e.g., Pollock's alcohol use, chaotic lifestyle, no commitment to abstinence), but the P-type arguments also oppose the claim by highlighting contradictions, anachronism, and lack of evidence. Since all arguments are against the claim, there is no P-type argument whose justification contains a semantic basis that supports the claim, violating C11's requirement for every minimal semantic basis of the claim to be contained in at least one P-type argument.
