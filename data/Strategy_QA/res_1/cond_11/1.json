Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications contain the minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments, which question the leader's personal involvement in saving JPEG images and highlight the lack of documented evidence. The P-type arguments focus on the group's general use of technology and digital media, but do not address the specific point about the leader's personal actions. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
