Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument provides a justification that supports the claim by highlighting aspects of King Kong's box office success compared to Naomi Watts' other roles. The S-type arguments, while presenting alternative perspectives on Watts' career milestones, do not contradict the claim about King Kong being her biggest box office role. The P-type arguments collectively cover the minimal semantic basis for the claim by addressing box office figures, comparison with other roles, and the film's scale and reach.
