Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provided do not support the claim that the Gunpowder plot eliminated Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline. Instead, they argue against it by stating that her bloodline continued through the Stuart dynasty and that the conspirators did not target her descendants. The S-type arguments also contradict the claim, providing evidence that the plot did not affect her bloodline. Therefore, there is no P-type argument whose justification contains a semantic subset that supports the claim.
