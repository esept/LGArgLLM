Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that cover various applications of biochemistry in geography, such as biogeography, environmental geography, and climatology. These justifications semantically encompass the support arguments (S-type), which argue that biochemistry is specialized and not typically part of core geographic methodologies. The P-type arguments show that while biochemistry is not universally used in geography, there are specific subfields where it is relevant, thus satisfying C11.
