Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications fully contain the semantic subsets provided by the S-type arguments. The S-type arguments introduce new points (e.g., ecosystem disruption, regulatory standards, cost) that are not addressed within the justifications of the P-type arguments. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
