Result: false  
Justification: The support arguments (S-type) provided do not align with the claim's minimal semantic basis. The S-type arguments discuss the unsuitability of backpack transport for primates due to their well-being and legal restrictions, which do not support the claim that you can transport a primate in a backpack. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied as there are no S-type arguments whose justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications that support the claim.
