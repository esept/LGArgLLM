Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide minimal semantic support sets that contradict the claim, stating that Mennonite communities limit exposure to secular media and prioritize traditional content, which would reduce the likelihood of children knowing about The Powerpuff Girls. None of the P-type arguments' justifications fully contain these bases; instead, they offer conflicting reasons (e.g., global popularity, digital access) that do not align with the S-type arguments' semantic subsets. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
