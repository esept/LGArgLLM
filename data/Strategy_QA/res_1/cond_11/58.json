Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide reasons why the boy might pray to Pan, focusing on Pan's role as a god of shepherds and the cultural context. However, none of the S-type arguments (which oppose the claim) have justifications that are semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications. The S-type arguments focus on the fable's moral lesson and lack of religious context, which do not overlap with the P-type arguments' justifications about Pan's relevance. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
