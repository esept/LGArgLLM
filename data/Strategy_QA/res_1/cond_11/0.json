Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide comprehensive justifications that cover the potential risks of having a jackfruit thrown at one's head, including the weight, force, and size of the jackfruit. The S-type arguments provide specific details (hard, spiky exterior and irregular shape) that are subsets of the broader justifications in the P-type arguments. Each minimal semantic basis (specific risks like lacerations, puncture wounds, and unpredictable impact) is contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments. Thus, C11 is satisfied.
