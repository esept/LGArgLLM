    text: "While the equation is mathematically true, being taught in education doesn't prove its truth - many false concepts have been taught historically."

    attacks:
      A4: 0.45

  - id: B2
    text: "The argument relies on authority/education rather than mathematical proof, which is a logical fallacy."

      A4: 0.60

  - id: C1
    text: "However, in this specific case, the mathematical truth can be independently verified: 3²=9, 4²=16, 5²=25, and 9+16=25."

  - id: C2
    text: "The original argument specifically references elementary mathematics education, which operates within standard Euclidean geometry where the theorem is universally valid."
