    text: "Following the order of operations (PEMDAS), parentheses are evaluated first: (8 - 3) = 5 and (2 + 1) = 3, then multiplication gives 5 × 3 = 15."

    cate: "P"
    text: "The distributive property confirms the result: (8 - 3) × (2 + 1) = 8×2 + 8×1 - 3×2 - 3×1 = 16 + 8 - 6 - 3 = 15."

    cate: "P"
    text: "Direct calculation shows 8 minus 3 equals 5, and 2 plus 1 equals 3, and 5 multiplied by 3 equals 15."
  - id: A4
    cate: "P"
    text: "Mathematical consistency requires that arithmetic operations follow established rules, and applying these rules to this expression yields 15."
  - id: A5
    cate: "P"
    text: "Verification through substitution: if we let x = (8 - 3) and y = (2 + 1), then x = 5 and y = 3, and x × y = 15."
