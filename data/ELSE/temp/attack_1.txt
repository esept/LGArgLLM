    text: "While 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5² is mathematically correct, the argument assumes the Pythagorean theorem applies universally, but it only holds in Euclidean geometry and fails in non-Euclidean spaces."

    text: "The argument focuses on it being the 'smallest' Pythagorean triple, but (0,0,0) and (1,0,1) could be considered degenerate cases that are numerically smaller, challenging the uniqueness claim."
