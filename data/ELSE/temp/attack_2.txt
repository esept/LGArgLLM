    text: "This argument assumes standard arithmetic operations, but in modular arithmetic (mod 3), 3² + 4² = 0 + 1 = 1, while 5² = 1, so it still holds, but the reasoning about 'confirmation' is context-dependent."

    text: "The argument only verifies this specific case but doesn't prove the general Pythagorean theorem for all right triangles, so its scope is limited to this particular equation."
