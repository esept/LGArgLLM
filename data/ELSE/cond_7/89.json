Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint; they share overlapping elements related to Dirac's Nobel Prize, such as the year (1933), the field (Physics), and the reasons for the award (e.g., contributions to quantum theory or the Dirac equation), which collectively support the claim.
