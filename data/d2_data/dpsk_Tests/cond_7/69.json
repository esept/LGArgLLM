Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common semantic subset related to the presence of hair in whales and its connection to their classification as mammals. For example, the first argument mentions that all mammals possess hair, and the second argument states that whales exhibit hair during embryonic development. These justifications overlap in their support of the claim that whales are mammals due to the presence of hair.
