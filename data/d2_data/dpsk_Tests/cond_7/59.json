Result: false
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic subset of supporting the claim that the Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Each justification provides different details (e.g., construction, locks, geographic locations, trade importance) but all contribute to the same overarching idea. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
