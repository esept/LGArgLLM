Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the mechanisms by which obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, and adipokine dysregulation. For example, the first and second arguments both mention insulin-related issues (insulin resistance and insulin signaling interference), and the third and fourth arguments both discuss the role of adipose tissue and adipokines. Therefore, the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
