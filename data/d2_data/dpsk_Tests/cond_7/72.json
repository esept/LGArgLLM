Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that the claim follows from the transitive property of set inclusion or the definition of subsets. For example, the first and second justifications both refer to the definition of subsets and the transitive property, respectively, which are directly related. Similarly, the third, fourth, and fifth justifications all reiterate the idea of containment or transitivity in set theory. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
