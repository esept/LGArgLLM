Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that Venus's rotational period (day) is longer than its orbital period (year), even though they provide different details (e.g., exact durations, retrograde rotation, observational confirmation). Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
