Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset related to how paying only the minimum on a credit card leads to increased interest charges. They overlap in discussing aspects like extended repayment periods, compounding interest, slow principal reduction, and the impact of APR. Since none of the pairs are semantically disjoint, the result is false.
