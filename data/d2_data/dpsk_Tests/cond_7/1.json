Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that supports the claim by evaluating the arithmetic expression (8 − 3) × (2 + 1) to 15. They all rely on the correctness of the arithmetic operations and the order of operations, leading to the same conclusion. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
