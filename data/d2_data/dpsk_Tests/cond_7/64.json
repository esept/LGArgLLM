Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference experimental or observational evidence (e.g., sharp shadows, astronomical observations) and theoretical principles (e.g., geometric optics, Fermat's principle) that all support the claim that light travels in straight lines in a vacuum. Since the justifications are not semantically disjoint, the result is false.
