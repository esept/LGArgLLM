```
Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint as they all revolve around the same core idea that judges in civil law systems interpret rather than create law, citing various aspects such as codified statutes, legislative supremacy, deductive reasoning, separation of powers, non-binding decisions, and legal training. However, since the task is to determine if at least one pair is disjoint, and none of the pairs here are disjoint, the correct answer is false. But given the instructions, if at least one pair is disjoint, return True. Since none are disjoint, the correct output should be False. However, the initial interpretation might have been incorrect. 

Corrected Output:
```
Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that judges in civil law systems interpret but do not create law, discussing related aspects like codified statutes, legislative supremacy, and separation of powers. No pair of justifications is semantically disjoint.
