Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by providing different perspectives (astronomical, meteorological, daylight characteristics, and cultural recognition) that support the idea that summer in the Northern Hemisphere begins in June. There is overlap in their contributions to the claim.
