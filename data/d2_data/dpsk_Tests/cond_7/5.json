Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct reasons supporting the claim. For example, one justification cites the U.S. Constitution, another references a Supreme Court case, another mentions international legal standards, and yet another discusses prosecutorial harassment. Each justification contributes a unique perspective or evidence to support the claim without overlapping in meaning.
