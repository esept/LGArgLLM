Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all share a common semantic subset related to the geological activity and stress at tectonic plate boundaries leading to earthquakes. For example, multiple arguments mention the release of stress or the presence of faults at plate boundaries, and others reference seismic data or historical records showing concentration of earthquakes near plate boundaries. These justifications overlap in their support for the claim.
