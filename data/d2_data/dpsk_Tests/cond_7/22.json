Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all relate to the zero product property in algebra or its implications in different mathematical contexts (real numbers, ring theory, polynomial equations). Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
