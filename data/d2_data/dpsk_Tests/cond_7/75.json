Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that hypertension is defined as blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg, as stated by authoritative sources like the American Heart Association, WHO, medical textbooks, clinical trials, the European Society of Cardiology, and epidemiological studies. There is no pair of arguments whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
