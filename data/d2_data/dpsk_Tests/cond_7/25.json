Given the arguments and their justifications, let's analyze the semantic overlap:

1. Argument 1: "If B is 10 in 2025, B was born in 2015 (2025 - 10 = 2015)."
   - Justification: Calculates B's birth year based on age in 2025.

2. Argument 2: "A is 5 years older than B, so A was born in 2010 (2015 - 5 = 2010)."
   - Justification: Uses B's birth year (from Argument 1) to calculate A's birth year.

The justifications are not semantically disjoint because Argument 2's justification depends on the result of Argument 1's justification (B's birth year). They share a common semantic element (B's birth year) that contributes to supporting the claim.

Result: false
Justification: The justifications are not disjoint as Argument 2 builds upon the result of Argument 1 (B's birth year).
