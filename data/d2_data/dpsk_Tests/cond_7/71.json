Result: false
Justification: All justifications for the arguments are based on the same logical principle (modus tollens) and overlap in their semantic content. They all explain that if A implies B and B is false, then A must be false, either by invoking modus tollens directly, by discussing logical implications, or by pointing out contradictions. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
