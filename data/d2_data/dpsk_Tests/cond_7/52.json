Result: false
Justification: All justifications provided for the arguments are semantically overlapping with respect to the claim, as they all directly support the statement about the EU having 27 member countries in 2025 by citing official sources, treaties, or operational details. None of the pairs of justifications are disjoint in their support for the claim.
