Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the definition of a prime number, the second and third on the criteria for a natural number, and the fourth combines both concepts. There is no overlap in the semantic content of the justifications that directly supports the claim in the same way.
