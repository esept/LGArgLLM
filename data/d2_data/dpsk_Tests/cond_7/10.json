Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is the positive correlation between risk and return in investments. Each argument provides a different perspective or example (e.g., historical data, CAPM, venture capital, high-yield bonds, behavioral finance) but all fundamentally support the idea that higher risk is associated with higher potential return. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
