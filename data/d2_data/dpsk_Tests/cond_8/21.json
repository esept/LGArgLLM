Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea related to the claim. The first argument defines 7 as a prime number, the second and third arguments define 7 as a natural number, and the fourth argument combines both ideas by stating that prime numbers are a subset of natural numbers. Thus, all arguments overlap in their justifications by either directly or indirectly supporting that 7 is both a prime and a natural number.
