Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the subset relation is transitive, which directly supports the claim. Each argument either explicitly mentions the transitive property of set inclusion or logically derives the conclusion from the definitions of subsets and containment, ensuring that every pair of arguments overlaps in their reasoning.
