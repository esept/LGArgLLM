Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the difference between 1995 and 2025 is 30 years, which directly supports the claim. Each argument either explicitly states this calculation or refers to standard chronological or calendar-based methods that confirm this result. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in their semantic justifications with respect to the claim.
