Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that light travels in straight lines in a vacuum, supported by various justifications such as laws of geometric optics, experimental observations, Einstein's theory of relativity, Fermat's principle, astronomical observations, and wavefront behavior. Each pair of arguments overlaps in their semantic justifications by reinforcing the claim through different but related scientific principles and observations.
