Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The first and third arguments both mention the June solstice as the astronomical start of summer. The second and fourth arguments both reference cultural or calendar-based definitions of summer starting in June. The third and fourth arguments both tie the start of summer to observable or practical phenomena (daylight duration and seasonal activities). Thus, every pair has at least one common idea supporting the claim.
