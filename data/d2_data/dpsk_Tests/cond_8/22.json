Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the zero product property in algebra (or ring theory) implies that if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. This core idea is present in all justifications, either explicitly or implicitly, through references to algebraic properties, real numbers, or polynomial equations.
