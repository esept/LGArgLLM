Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument references legal principles (e.g., Fifth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, Supreme Court rulings, international human rights standards) or concerns about the reliability and fairness of coerced confessions. These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments intersects in their reasoning about why coerced confessions may be inadmissible in court.
