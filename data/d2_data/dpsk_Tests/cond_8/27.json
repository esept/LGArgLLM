Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that people born before 1990 will be at least 36 years old in 2025, which is over 35. Each argument either provides a specific example (e.g., born in 1989 or 1980) or a general mathematical proof (e.g., any birth year before 1990 results in an age greater than 35 in 2025). Thus, all pairs of arguments overlap in their core reasoning supporting the claim.
