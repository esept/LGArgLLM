Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument calculates B's birth year based on B's age in 2025, while the second argument calculates A's birth year based on A being 5 years older than B. There is no common idea or proposition in their justifications that directly supports the claim about A's age in 2010.
