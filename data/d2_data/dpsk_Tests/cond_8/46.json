Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either cites scientific or nutritional evidence (e.g., USDA, nutritional databases), mentions the role of potassium in bananas (e.g., electrolyte balance, plant growth), or refers to bananas as a dietary source of potassium (e.g., for replenishment after exertion). The core idea—that bananas naturally contain potassium—is consistently supported across all justifications.
