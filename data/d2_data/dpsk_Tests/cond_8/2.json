Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea of verifying the claim through algebraic manipulation or substitution of x = 2 into the equation 3x + 1. Each justification either directly substitutes x = 2 and evaluates the expression, or simplifies the equation to confirm the relationship, thus overlapping in their semantic support for the claim.
