Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that tectonic plate boundaries are the primary locations for earthquake occurrence due to geological activity, stress accumulation, and fault generation. Each justification reinforces this central theme, either by citing specific examples (e.g., Pacific Ring of Fire), referencing scientific data, or explaining the underlying mechanisms (e.g., plate movement, stress release). Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in supporting the claim.
