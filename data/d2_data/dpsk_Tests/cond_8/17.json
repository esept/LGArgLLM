Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument refers to the geometric properties of a square (four right angles, opposite sides equal and parallel) and how these properties satisfy the definition of a rectangle. Additionally, several arguments mention the hierarchical classification of quadrilaterals, where a square is a subset of rectangles. These common ideas ensure that every pair of arguments has at least one overlapping justification supporting the claim.
