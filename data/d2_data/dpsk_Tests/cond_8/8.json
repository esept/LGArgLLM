Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that in civil law systems, judges are restricted to interpreting existing laws and do not have the authority to create new laws. Each justification reinforces this central theme by highlighting different aspects such as codified statutes, legislative supremacy, deductive reasoning, separation of powers, non-binding judicial decisions, and legal training focused on statutory texts. The semantic overlap is clear as all justifications converge on the same core proposition supporting the claim.
