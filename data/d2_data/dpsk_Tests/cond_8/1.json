Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either directly evaluates the arithmetic expressions (8 − 3) and (2 + 1) to 5 and 3 respectively, or confirms the multiplication of these results (5 × 3) to be 15. The common idea across all justifications is the step-by-step arithmetic verification of the claim, ensuring semantic overlap in every pair.
