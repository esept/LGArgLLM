Result: true  
Justification: Both justifications share a common semantic core related to calculating the birth years of A and B based on their ages and the given year. The first justification calculates B's birth year, and the second uses that to calculate A's birth year, which is then used to determine A's age in 2010. The logical steps are consistent and support the claim together.
