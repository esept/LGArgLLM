Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They all reference the rectilinear (straight-line) propagation of light in a vacuum, either through theoretical principles (geometric optics, Fermat's principle, relativity), experimental observations (sharp shadows), or astronomical evidence (no deviation in light paths, planar wavefronts). The intersection of these justifications is the consistent assertion that light travels in straight lines in a vacuum.
