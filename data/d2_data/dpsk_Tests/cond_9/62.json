Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that bees are essential for crop pollination, either by describing the mechanism (pollen transfer), providing evidence (studies, yield increases), or showing consequences (decline impacts, commercial use). Each justification reinforces the claim that bees play a role in pollinating crops.
