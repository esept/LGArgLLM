Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification emphasizes that tectonic plate boundaries are zones of high geological activity where stress accumulates and is released, leading to earthquakes. This is consistently backed by scientific data, historical records, and the concentration of seismic activity along known plate boundaries like the Pacific Ring of Fire. The justifications collectively reinforce the same underlying reason for the claim.
