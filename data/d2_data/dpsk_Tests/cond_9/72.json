Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core based on the transitive property of set inclusion and the definition of subsets. Each argument either explicitly mentions the transitive property or logically derives the conclusion from the definition of subsets, ensuring that every element of C is in E. This consistent overlap in meaning supports the claim uniformly.
