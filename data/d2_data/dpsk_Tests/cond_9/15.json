Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that distance traveled is calculated by multiplying constant speed by time, and they all explicitly or implicitly confirm the linear relationship (60 km/h * 3 h = 180 km). The arguments uniformly support the claim using this shared mathematical and physical principle.
