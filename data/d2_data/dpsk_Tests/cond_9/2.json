Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core of verifying the claim by substituting x = 2 into the equation 3x + 1 and showing that it equals 7. Each argument provides a slightly different perspective (e.g., algebraic manipulation, direct substitution, or evaluation), but all ultimately rely on the same mathematical truth to support the claim.
