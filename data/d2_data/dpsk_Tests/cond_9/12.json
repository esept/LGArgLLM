Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that compound interest grows faster than simple interest due to earning interest on both principal and accumulated interest, following an exponential growth pattern, and resulting in higher returns over time. Each argument reinforces this central idea with slightly different emphases (mathematical, financial models, historical data, etc.), but all align on the same fundamental support for the claim.
