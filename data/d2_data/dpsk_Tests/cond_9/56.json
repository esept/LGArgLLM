Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that Venus's rotational period (day) is longer than its orbital period (year), supported by specific numerical data (243 vs. 225 Earth days) and observational evidence. Each argument reinforces this central idea with additional details (e.g., retrograde rotation, sunrise duration, mission data), but the foundational overlap is consistent.
