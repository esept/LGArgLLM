Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by demonstrating the correctness of the equation 3² + 4² = 5² through mathematical calculation, reference to the Pythagorean theorem, and the concept of Pythagorean triples. Each justification reinforces the validity of the claim from slightly different angles, but all converge on the same foundational truth.
