Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically in supporting the claim. For example, the first argument states that English is the primary official language, and the second argument provides census data supporting the widespread use of English. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments discuss the dominance of English in daily use and public institutions, which aligns with the first argument. Thus, no pair of arguments has justifications that are entirely disjoint with respect to the claim.
