Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic themeâ€”they all argue that mirrors do not have any observable or scientifically supported effects when placed by a bed. They overlap in meaning by emphasizing the lack of physical interaction, scientific evidence, or empirical support for any claims of effects. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
