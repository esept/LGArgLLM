Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a different aspect of gun laws in the US (e.g., federal prohibitions, background checks, constitutional rights, and restricted locations), and none of them share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
