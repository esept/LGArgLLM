Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the lack of scientific evidence or medical consensus about French people having bad breath, while the second argument emphasizes the high standard of dental care and oral hygiene practices in France. These justifications address different aspects (evidence vs. practices) and do not share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
