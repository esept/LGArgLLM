Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the climatic types (temperate oceanic vs. humid continental) as the reason for milder winters in Paris, while the second argument cites historical weather data showing lower winter lows in Philadelphia. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
