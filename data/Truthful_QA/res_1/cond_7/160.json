Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share the common semantic theme that food prices in Canada have increased since 1970, supported by different but overlapping reasons (inflation-adjusted data, global factors, and government reports). Since none of the pairs of arguments have justifications that are completely unrelated to each other or the claim, the result is false in terms of disjointness. However, the task asks to return True if at least one pair is disjoint, which is not the case here, so the correct output is False. But given the phrasing of the task, the correct interpretation is that since no pair is disjoint, the result is False. However, the initial instruction says to return True if at least one pair is disjoint, which is not the case here, so the correct output is False. 

Given the confusion, the correct output based on the actual justifications is:
```
Result: false
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic content related to rising food prices in Canada since 1970, so no pair is disjoint.
