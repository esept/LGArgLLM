Result: true
Justification: All justifications in the arguments overlap semantically, as they all focus on the context of Nixon's statement being related to the Watergate scandal and not his personal finances. However, since the task is to determine if at least one pair is disjoint, and all pairs here are overlapping, the result should be false. But given the phrasing of the task, if all pairs are overlapping, the result is false. However, the correct interpretation is that if all pairs are overlapping, then there are no disjoint pairs, so the result is false. But the initial instruction says "If at least one pair is disjoint, return True. Otherwise, return False." Since no pairs are disjoint, the correct answer is false.

Correction: 

```
Result: false
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic subset, as they all argue that Nixon's statement was about the Watergate scandal and not his personal finances. Therefore, no pair is disjoint.
