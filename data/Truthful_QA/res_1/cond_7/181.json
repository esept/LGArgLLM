Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint as they all relate to different legal frameworks and principles in the UK that make recording children illegal under various circumstances. For example, one argument cites the Data Protection Act 2018, another the GDPR, and another the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, all of which contribute to the claim that recording children is illegal in the UK. Therefore, there is overlap in their support for the claim.
