Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument cites official labor statistics showing increased weekly working hours since 2000, while the second argument discusses technological advancements blurring work-life boundaries. These justifications address different aspects (statistical evidence vs. qualitative factors) and do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim. Similarly, other arguments (e.g., economic pressures, historical data, unpaid overtime, union decline) each provide distinct reasons without overlapping meaning.
