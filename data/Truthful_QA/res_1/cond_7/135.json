Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference the fact that Donald Trump was not selected as Time's Person of the Year during or after his presidency, and that Joe Biden was selected in 2020. These points are repeated across different arguments, indicating semantic overlap rather than disjointness.
