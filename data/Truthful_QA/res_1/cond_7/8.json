Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the overall popularity and sales volume of beer in the U.S. compared to Europe, while the second argument highlights the impact of the U.S. craft beer movement on domestic consumption. These justifications address different aspects of beer consumption in the U.S. and do not share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim.
