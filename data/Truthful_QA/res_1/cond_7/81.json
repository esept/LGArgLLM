Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all refute the interpretation of 'AD' as 'After Death' and provide evidence for its correct meaning as 'Anno Domini'. None of the pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
