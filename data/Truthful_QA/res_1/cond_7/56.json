Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All arguments share the common semantic theme that porcupines do not actively fire their quills but rely on passive defense mechanisms. For example, the first argument states that quills detach only upon direct contact, while the second and third arguments elaborate on passive defense and the lack of active propulsion, respectively. The fourth argument further supports this by noting the absence of anatomical mechanisms for projectile ejection. Thus, there is overlap in meaning among the justifications.
