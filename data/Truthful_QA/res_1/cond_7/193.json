Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim by emphasizing the motivational and actionable aspects of dreaming about future success. For example, multiple arguments mention that such dreams can inspire action, improve performance, and increase self-confidence, all of which are related to the idea that dreaming alone is insufficient without effort. Thus, the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
