Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that England has no formal system of book banning or that very few books are prohibited by law, which are semantically similar points supporting the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
