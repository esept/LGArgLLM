Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both reference statistical and historical data supporting the prevalence of Christianity in New York, indicating an overlap in their semantic content. However, the third argument introduces a counterpoint about demographic shifts potentially reducing the Christian percentage, which is semantically distinct from the other arguments. Since at least one pair (e.g., the third argument vs. the others) is disjoint, the result is true.
