Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first argument mentions Bangkok's high number of international arrivals (over 20 million), and the third argument also refers to data ranking Bangkok higher than Paris in terms of annual international arrivals. Both justifications share the common semantic subset of "Bangkok has more international arrivals than Paris," contributing to the support of the claim. Thus, there is overlap in meaning among the justifications.
