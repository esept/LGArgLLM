Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically as they all reference statistical data or surveys from Canada or similar Western countries to support the claim that the proportion of straight people in Canada is 94-96%. For example, multiple arguments cite Statistics Canada or other surveys indicating that non-heterosexual identities account for less than 10% of the population, which directly supports the claim. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
