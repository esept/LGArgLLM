Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why the Betsy Ross story is likely apocryphal, such as lack of contemporaneous evidence, the role of her grandson in popularizing the story, the official credit given to Francis Hopkinson, the alignment with 19th-century patriotic narratives, and the absence of surviving flags linked to Ross. None of these justifications overlap in meaning; they each address separate aspects of the claim.
