Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each provide distinct reasons supporting the claim. The first argument cites specific CDC data, the second focuses on consistency over recent years, the third discusses national trends, and the fourth highlights unique factors in West Virginia. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to the claim.
