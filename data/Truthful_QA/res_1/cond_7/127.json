Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the failure of replication studies, the second on the original study's findings, and the third on broader research in nonverbal behavior. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
