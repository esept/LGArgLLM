Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to how chameleons change colors for thermoregulation, focusing on mechanisms (chromatophores), observed behaviors (darker/lighter hues in different temperatures), and scientific evidence (infrared imaging). None of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
