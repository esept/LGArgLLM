Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., military testing facility, lack of empirical support for conspiracy theories, declassified documents, and lack of credible links found by researchers) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. All justifications independently support the claim without sharing a common semantic subset.
