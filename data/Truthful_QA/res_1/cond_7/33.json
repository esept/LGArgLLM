Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the same semantic subsetâ€”how porcupines use their tails and quills defensively. The first argument describes the tail-swinging behavior, the second explains the effectiveness of the quills, and the third contrasts this defense mechanism with other possible attacks. Since all justifications contribute to the same core idea (tail-quill defense), none are semantically disjoint.
