Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification focuses on the technical aspect of ATM software not being designed to detect reversed PIN sequences, while the second justification discusses the official protocols of banks and financial institutions for fraud detection. There is no overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim.
