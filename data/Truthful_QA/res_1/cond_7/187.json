Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the biological processes (genetics and hormones) causing baldness, while the second argument discusses medical treatments (minoxidil or finasteride) as targeting the root causes. There is no overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim.
