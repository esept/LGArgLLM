Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content related to obesity rates and contributing factors in the U.S. and Australia. For example, arguments about obesity rates (e.g., "Regional studies indicate that certain U.S. states have obesity rates exceeding 40%") and contributing factors (e.g., "Australia's higher consumption of processed foods") share common themes, so they are not semantically disjoint.
