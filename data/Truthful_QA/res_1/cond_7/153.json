Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the etymological origin of the word "shit" from Old English and Proto-Germanic. They reference linguistic evolution, etymological dictionaries, comparative linguistics, historical linguistic studies, and phonetic shifts, all of which contribute to supporting the claim. Therefore, none of the pairs of arguments have justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
