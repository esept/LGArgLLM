Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to the thermodynamic principles underlying boiling (heat application and kinetic energy). Similarly, the third and fifth arguments both reference empirical observations or experiments confirming that water boils under heat. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
