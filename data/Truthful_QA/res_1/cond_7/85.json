Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument discusses the general protection under the U.K. Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the second focuses on fair dealing exceptions, and the third addresses the absence of 'fair use' in the U.K. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim about not making money off copyrighted work.
