Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason or evidence for the decrease in food affordability (e.g., inflation-adjusted data, income growth not keeping pace, food insecurity rates, production costs, disposable income spent on food, comparative studies). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
