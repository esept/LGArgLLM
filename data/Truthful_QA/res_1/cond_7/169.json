Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. They all reference historical evidence (works by scholars, established concepts in universities, explicit writings, and navigational knowledge) that collectively support the idea that medieval scholars thought the Earth was round. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
