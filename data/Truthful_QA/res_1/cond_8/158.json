Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument highlights the disproportionate number of Nobel Prizes won by Jewish people relative to their population, the second provides historical data supporting this, and the third reinforces this by considering per capita wins. All justifications revolve around the high number or proportion of Nobel Prizes won by Jewish people compared to Christians, thus sharing common reasoning patterns.
