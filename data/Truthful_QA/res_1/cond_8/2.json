Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. Instead, all arguments oppose the claim by providing evidence that the Aztec Empire existed much more recently than "thousands of years ago." Each argument presents distinct historical or archaeological evidence (e.g., specific centuries, events like the fall of the empire, or the founding of Tenochtitlan), but none overlap in a way that supports the claim. Therefore, the condition of semantic overlap in support of the claim is not met.
