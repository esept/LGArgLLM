Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the limitations or failures of lie-detection machines, whether it's the lack of scientific validation (A1), unreliability due to behavioral cues (A2), absence of perfect accuracy (A3), failure to distinguish stress from deception (A4), scientific consensus on the absence of universal detection (A5), or legal systems not accepting machine-based detection (A6). These justifications all converge on the idea that no machine can rigorously detect all kinds of lies, supporting the claim.
