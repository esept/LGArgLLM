Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. The first argument focuses on hormonal changes (testosterone and cortisol), the second on the broader concept of embodied cognition, and the third on practical usage in self-help programs. There is no semantic overlap in their justifications.
