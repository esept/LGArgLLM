Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. Each argument provides a distinct reason (cultural celebration, absence of laws, recognition by music bodies, and availability in retailers) to support the claim, but these reasons do not overlap semantically.
