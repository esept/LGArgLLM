Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either references official records, standard practices, historical accounts, or debunks myths, all of which support the claim that no bodies are buried in the Hoover Dam. The common themes include official documentation, historical accuracy, and construction practices, ensuring semantic overlap between any two arguments.
