Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the lack of empirical or scientific evidence supporting any effect from placing a mirror by the bed, whether it's about physical changes, influence on sleep or health, or debunking superstitions. The common theme is the absence of any observable or scientifically validated impact.
