Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. Each argument focuses on the context of Nixon's statement being about the Watergate scandal and political misconduct, not his personal finances, but they do not share any common idea or reasoning pattern beyond this general context. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
