Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the exceptional nature of consistently achieving over 15% annual returns for a decade, highlighting aspects such as outperforming the market average (S&P 500 benchmark), rarity of such performance, the reduction of luck due to long-term consistency, and the recognition of such investors as great in financial literature. The common themes of superior skill, long-term outperformance, and market benchmarks ensure semantic overlap across all argument pairs.
