Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the first argument focuses on the absolute number of obese individuals due to population size, while the third argument discusses regional obesity rates in specific U.S. states compared to Australia. These justifications do not intersect in terms of common ideas or reasoning patterns supporting the claim. Similarly, the second argument discusses public health campaigns and trends in obesity rates, which does not overlap with the fourth argument's focus on processed food consumption and sedentary lifestyles. Thus, not all pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications.
