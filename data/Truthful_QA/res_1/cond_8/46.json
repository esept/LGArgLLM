Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not all share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. For example, the first argument focuses on the common practice of discussing Shakespeare's works, while the second argument addresses the lack of evidence for bad luck. These are distinct points that do not overlap semantically.
