Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the human hand has 10 finger bones, with justifications focusing on anatomical structure, medical literature, X-ray evidence, and textbook references. Each pair of arguments overlaps in supporting the claim by referencing the same anatomical fact (thumb having 2 bones and other fingers having 3 bones, totaling 10 per hand).
