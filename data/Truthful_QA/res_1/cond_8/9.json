Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument highlights a different aspect of why determining the greatest basketball player is ambiguous (e.g., era differences, statistical variability, subjective criteria, biases, and external factors like injuries). These aspects collectively support the claim by emphasizing the lack of a clear, objective standard for comparison. Thus, every pair of arguments intersects in their reasoning about the ambiguity of the claim.
