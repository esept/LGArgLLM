Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that porcupines use their tails as a defensive mechanism against predators. The first argument describes the action of swinging the tail, the second explains the effectiveness of the quills, and the third emphasizes the tail-quill defense as the primary method. These justifications overlap in supporting the claim about porcupines' tail-based attack strategy.
