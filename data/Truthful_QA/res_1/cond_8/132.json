Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided actually contradict the claim, stating that people in the US drink more coffee than in Mexico. The justifications do not overlap in supporting the original claim but rather oppose it by presenting evidence of higher coffee consumption in the US. Therefore, there is no semantic intersection in the justifications that supports the original claim.
