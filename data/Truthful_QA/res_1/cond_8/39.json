Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument cites statistical data or surveys (e.g., Statistics Canada's 2021 census, Canadian Community Health Survey, demographic studies) that consistently report the proportion of heterosexual identification in Canada as being within the 90-96% range. The justifications all revolve around the same core idea: the majority of Canadians identify as heterosexual, with non-heterosexual identities accounting for a small minority (less than 10%). This common reasoning pattern and shared data sources ensure semantic overlap across all argument pairs.
