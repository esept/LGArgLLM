Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern that supports the claim. The first argument discusses the general protection under the U.K. Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the second focuses on fair dealing exceptions, and the third addresses the absence of 'fair use' in the U.K. None of these justifications directly overlap in meaning with respect to the claim about protecting oneself by not making money off copyrighted work.
