Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either cites studies or regulatory standards that support the safety of nuclear power, compares its risks favorably to other energy sources, or discusses mitigation of its perceived dangers. For example, arguments about mortality rates, accident rarity, pollution reduction, and regulatory oversight all intersect on the idea that nuclear power is safe relative to other energy sources, as supported by scientific or regulatory evidence.
