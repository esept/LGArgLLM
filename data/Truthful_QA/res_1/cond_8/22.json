Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share overlapping semantic justifications (e.g., both discuss the nature of the holidays as national celebrations or their historical origins), not all pairs do. For example, the argument about Cinco de Mayo being primarily celebrated regionally in Puebla does not semantically overlap with the argument about the holidays evolving beyond their historical origins. Thus, not all pairs share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
