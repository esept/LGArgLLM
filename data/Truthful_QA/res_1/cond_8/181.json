Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that recording children without proper authorization or consent is illegal under various UK laws and regulations. Each argument cites different specific laws (Data Protection Act 2018, GDPR, Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, Human Rights Act 1998, Investigatory Powers Act 2016) or general legal principles (safeguarding policies, privacy breaches), but all converge on the idea that unauthorized recording of children is prohibited by UK law. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in this core reasoning.
