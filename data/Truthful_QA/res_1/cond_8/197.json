Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that James Watson and Gerald Edelman were born in the United States and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which directly supports the claim. The justifications also consistently reference the official recognition of their achievements by the Nobel Prize records, reinforcing the claim's validity.
