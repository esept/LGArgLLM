Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that prolonged or improper screen use (specifically sitting close to the television) can lead to eyestrain, though they cite different mechanisms (muscle contraction, reduced blinking, and the need for breaks). The justifications are semantically related as they all support the claim by explaining different aspects of how eyestrain occurs from screen proximity.
