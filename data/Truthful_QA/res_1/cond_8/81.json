Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why 'AD' does not mean 'After Death', such as linguistic origin, historical context, logical inconsistency, and authoritative rejection. While all arguments support the same conclusion, their justifications do not share common ideas or reasoning patterns.
