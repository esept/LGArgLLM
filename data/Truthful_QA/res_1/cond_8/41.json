Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument cites evidence or reasoning that supports the idea that providing video recordings does not significantly affect class attendance, whether through studies, student preferences, institutional reports, empirical data, or the value of live interaction. The common theme across all justifications is the stability of attendance despite the availability of recordings.
