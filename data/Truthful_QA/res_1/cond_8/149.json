Result: false
Justification: While all arguments support the claim that per capita income is higher in the US than in Japan, their justifications do not all overlap semantically. For example, the first argument cites specific income figures from the World Bank, while the second argument discusses the US's larger and more diversified economy. These justifications are distinct and do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern. Similarly, other arguments focus on different aspects like aging population, technological innovation, and currency exchange rates, which do not overlap in meaning with each other or with the first argument. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications.
