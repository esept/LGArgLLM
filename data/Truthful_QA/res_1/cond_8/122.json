Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the failure of Bem's study to replicate, the lack of robust evidence for precognition, and the consensus that no scientific phenomenon was established. The justifications consistently highlight methodological flaws, statistical artifacts, and the absence of successful replications, which are common themes across all arguments.
