Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea related to income inequality metrics (e.g., Gini coefficient), economic disparities (e.g., middle class size, poverty rates), or policy differences (e.g., taxation, social welfare) between the US and Brazil. These overlapping semantic justifications consistently support the claim that US incomes are less unequal than those in Brazil.
