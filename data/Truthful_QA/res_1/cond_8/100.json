Result: false
Justification: While many pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications (e.g., "Official labor statistics" and "Historical data" both reference empirical data on working hours), not all pairs do. For example, "Technological advancements and remote work" and "The decline of union influence" address distinct factors (technology vs. labor organization) without clear semantic overlap in their justifications. Thus, not all pairs share a common idea or reasoning pattern.
