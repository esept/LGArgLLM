Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core centered around the lack of empirical validation, reproducible evidence, or scientific consensus for alternative medicine, which prevents universal acceptance by scientists. Each argument highlights different aspects (e.g., lack of testing, contradiction with established science, regulatory non-endorsement, inconclusive studies, reliance on placebo/anecdotes), but all converge on the idea that alternative medicine fails to meet the rigorous standards required for unanimous scientific approval.
