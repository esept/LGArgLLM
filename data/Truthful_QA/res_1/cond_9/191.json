Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments focus on absolute numbers due to population size (A1, A5), others on trends in obesity rates (A2), and others on regional comparisons (A3) or lifestyle factors (A4). There is no single shared basis across all justifications for the claim.
