Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first two justifications argue against the claim by stating restrictions on who can legally carry a gun, while the third justification supports the claim by citing constitutional protection of the right to bear arms. There is no intersection in meaning that collectively supports the claim.
