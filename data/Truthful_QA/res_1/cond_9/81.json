Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they uniformly contradict the claim by explaining that 'AD' stands for 'Anno Domini' and not 'After Death', and provide various reasons (linguistic, historical, logical) for this correct interpretation. There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim's meaning of 'AD' as 'After Death'.
