Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument suggests that short hair is practical and aligns with contemporary fashion, while the second argument highlights the prominence of short hair in fashion media. These points do not intersect semantically to support the claim that short hair implies a lack of care for fashion.
