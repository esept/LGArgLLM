Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification discusses how chameleons change colors (via chromatophores or skin hue) to regulate their body temperature, either by absorbing or reflecting heat. The justifications collectively reinforce the thermoregulation hypothesis with evidence from specialized cells, observed behavior, and scientific studies (e.g., infrared imaging). The overlap in meaning is clear and consistent.
