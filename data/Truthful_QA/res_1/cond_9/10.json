Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments (e.g., dreams being subjective and lacking empirical validation) support the claim that science does not say dreams can reveal something about us, while others (e.g., dreams reflecting subconscious aspects or being used in therapy) contradict it by suggesting dreams can indeed reveal personal insights. There is no intersection in meaning across all justifications.
