Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument states that intelligence is not determined by physical appearance, while the second argues that cultural norms make hair length an unreliable indicator. Neither supports the claim that short-haired women are more intelligent; instead, they both undermine it.
