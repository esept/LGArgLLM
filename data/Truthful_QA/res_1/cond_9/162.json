Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that rugby is not widely popular or prioritized in any country, either due to niche participation, lower popularity compared to other sports, physical demands, or limited media and sponsorship focus. This collective reasoning supports the claim that in no country do most people love playing rugby.
