Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that Donald Trump was a U.S. president who was not selected as Time's Person of the Year during or after his presidency, while other recent presidents (like Joe Biden and Barack Obama) were selected. This consistently supports the claim that Trump was the most recent U.S. president not selected for this honor.
