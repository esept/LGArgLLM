Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification either directly references the Old English term 'scitte' or the Proto-Germanic root '*skit-', and all align with linguistic evidence (e.g., etymological dictionaries, comparative linguistics, historical studies, and phonetic patterns) to confirm the claim's validity. The overlap in meaning is consistent across all arguments.
