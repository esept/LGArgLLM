Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The first justification argues the lack of evidence for the claim, while the second suggests that if the claim were true, it would be publicly advertised. Both justifications undermine the claim rather than supporting it, and they do not intersect in a way that collectively supports the claim's validity.
