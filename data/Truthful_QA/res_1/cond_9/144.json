Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not support the claim that "Our planet is the only one in the universe that can support life." Instead, they argue against it by presenting evidence and reasoning that suggest the possibility or likelihood of other planets supporting life. There is no common semantic core in the justifications that aligns with the claim's assertion of Earth's uniqueness in supporting life.
