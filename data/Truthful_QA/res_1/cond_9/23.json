Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by pointing to lack of evidence, historical transparency, scientific consensus, anecdotal nature of claims, and independent investigations finding no proof. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim; rather, the justifications uniformly oppose it.
