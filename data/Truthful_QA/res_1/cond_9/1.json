Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that dreams are subjective mental experiences without causal power to influence real-world outcomes, and thus wishing in a dream cannot guarantee success. Each argument reinforces this idea by emphasizing the lack of causative properties in dreams, the necessity of real-world actions for success, and the non-actionable nature of dream wishes.
