Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification references statistical data or surveys (e.g., Statistics Canada's 2021 census, Canadian Community Health Survey, demographic studies) indicating that the proportion of people identifying as heterosexual in Canada is consistently above 90%, with non-heterosexual identities accounting for less than 10%. This overlap in meaning across all justifications confirms a shared basis for the claim.
