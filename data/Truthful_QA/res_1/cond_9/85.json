Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first justification states that infringement occurs regardless of monetary benefit, the second highlights limited fair dealing exceptions, and the third emphasizes the absence of 'fair use' in the U.K. None of these collectively support the claim that not making money protects against infringement.
