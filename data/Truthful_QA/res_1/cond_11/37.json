Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide general reasons why the claim is unlikely (ATM software design and official bank protocols), but none of their justifications contain the specific minimal semantic support sets provided by the S-type arguments (lack of credible sources, ATM system priorities, absence of public documentation). Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
