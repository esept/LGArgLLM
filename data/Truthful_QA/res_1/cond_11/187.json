Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains semantic subsets from the S-type arguments. For example, the first P-type argument's justification includes the idea that shaving does not affect biological processes (from S-type arguments), and the second P-type argument's justification includes the idea that treatments target root causes (also from S-type arguments). Thus, all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments.
