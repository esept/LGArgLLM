Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains elements that align with the support arguments (S-type), which provide minimal semantic support for the claim. For example, the S-type argument about the Aztec Empire being founded in 1428 (less than 600 years ago) is a subset of the P-type arguments discussing the 15th and 16th centuries or the 14th century. Similarly, the S-type argument comparing the Aztec Empire to ancient civilizations is reflected in the P-type arguments about the Aztec timeline being well-documented and not ancient. Thus, all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments.
