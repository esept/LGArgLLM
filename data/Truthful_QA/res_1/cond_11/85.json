Result: false  
Justification: The claim suggests that not making money off copyrighted work protects against infringement claims in the U.K. However, the P-type arguments and S-type arguments collectively indicate that copyright infringement in the U.K. is not contingent on financial gain and that non-commercial use can still constitute infringement. The justifications of the P-type arguments do not contain the minimal semantic basis that supports the claim; instead, they contradict it by emphasizing that infringement can occur regardless of monetary benefit. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
