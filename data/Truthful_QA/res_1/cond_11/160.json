Result: false  
Justification: The claim states that the cost of food in Canada has decreased since 1970, but all the P-type arguments provided actually argue the oppositeâ€”that food costs have increased since 1970. Additionally, the S-type arguments also support the idea that food costs have risen, not decreased. Therefore, there is no P-type argument whose justification supports the claim, and C11 is not satisfied.
