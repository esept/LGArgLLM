Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains or aligns with the semantic content of at least one S-type argument, providing a minimal semantic basis for the claim. For example, the first P-type argument about studies controlling for socioeconomic factors aligns with the S-type argument about confounding variables, and the second P-type argument about meta-analyses showing small cognitive benefits aligns with the S-type argument about the PROBIT trial finding no significant differences. Thus, all minimal semantic bases for the claim are covered by the P-type arguments.
