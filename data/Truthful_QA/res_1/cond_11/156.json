Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim by citing the original study, embodied cognition theory, and practical usage. However, the S-type arguments (support arguments) do not provide fragments of minimal semantic support for the claim; instead, they contradict or undermine the claim by highlighting replication failures, methodological flaws, and weak effects. Thus, there is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of the P-type arguments' justifications and contributes to supporting the claim. C11 is not satisfied.
