Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim by associating short hair with professionalism through perceptions of practicality, no-nonsense attitude, and reduced distractions. However, the S-type arguments challenge the claim by asserting that professionalism is not determined by hair length and provide counterexamples and cultural variations. There is no P-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of the S-type arguments' justifications, nor do the P-type arguments cover all minimal semantic bases of the claim (e.g., the claim's subjectivity and cultural variability are not addressed by the P-type arguments). Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
