  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 \u03bcm3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Vitamin B12 injections would most likely have prevented this patient\"s oropharyngeal symptoms.",
