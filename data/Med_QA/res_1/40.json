  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pain. He reports that one hour ago he was climbing the stairs in his home when he suddenly developed excruciating chest pain. He describes the pain as ripping and radiating to the back. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for a heart murmur that is being followed by his outpatient cardiologist. He takes no medications. The patient works as a carpenter and reports being monogamous with his wife. He denies any history of intravenous drug use or recent travel. In the emergency department, the patient\u2019s temperature is 99.4\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 94/56 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to be in moderate distress and is clutching his chest. He is tall and has joint hypermobility. His breath sounds are equal and full bilaterally and has weak distal pulses.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: A systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space is most likely to be found in this patient.",
