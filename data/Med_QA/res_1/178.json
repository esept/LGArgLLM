  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police. He was found at a local celebration acting very strangely and was reported by other patrons of the event. The patient is very anxious and initially is hesitant to answer questions. He denies any substance use and states that he was just trying to have a good time. The patient\"s responses are slightly delayed and he seems to have difficulty processing his thoughts. The patient tells you he feels very anxious and asks for some medication to calm him down. The patient has a past medical history of psoriasis which is treated with topical steroids. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, you note an anxious young man. HEENT exam reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in his upper and lower extremities. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia, and pulmonary exam is within normal limits.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Marijuana is the most likely intoxication in this patient.",
