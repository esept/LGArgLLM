She has been living alone since the death of her husband 1 year ago. She appears thin and has temporal wasting bilaterally. Physical examination shows bruises on her lower legs, swollen gums, and petechiae on the hard palate.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance composed primarily of the amino acid Lysine.",
