Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim that the patient's condition is most likely caused by a deficiency in Vitamin intake. For example, multiple arguments mention broader nutritional deficiencies, micronutrient deficiencies, and the link between protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. These shared semantic elements indicate that the justifications are not disjoint with respect to the claim.
