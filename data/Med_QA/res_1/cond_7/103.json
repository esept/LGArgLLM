Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. All three arguments cite the patient's history of a heart attack and current symptoms (dyspnea, orthopnea) as reasons to suspect coronary artery disease or heart failure, which justifies angiography. Since none of the pairs of arguments have disjoint justifications, the result is false.
