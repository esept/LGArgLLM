Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments are semantically related to the claim, as they all discuss the association between fibrates (the likely prescribed drug) and decreased vitamin D absorption. They overlap in meaning by referencing fibrates' impact on bile acid metabolism and vitamin D absorption, as well as the patient's lipid profile matching the effects of fibrates. Thus, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
