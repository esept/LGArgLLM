Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the claim by explaining how mutations in the ATP2A1 gene lead to impaired calcium reuptake, prolonged muscle relaxation times, and increased cytosolic calcium concentration. The arguments overlap in their support of the claim through shared physiological and biochemical mechanisms.
