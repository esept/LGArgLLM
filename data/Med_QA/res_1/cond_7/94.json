Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the lymphatic or hematogenous spread of ovarian cancer to the brain, with some overlap in discussing the anatomical plausibility of the described route (e.g., thoracic duct, systemic circulation) and the mechanisms of metastasis (lymphatic vs. hematogenous spread). For example, the first and third arguments both discuss the thoracic duct and systemic circulation, while the second and fourth arguments discuss the mechanisms of spread (lymphatic vs. hematogenous). Thus, there is semantic overlap between the justifications of these arguments.
