Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both arguments relate to the contraindication of aspirin due to gastritis, with one focusing on the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and the other on the general avoidance of NSAIDs like aspirin for patients with gastritis. Both justifications contribute to the same underlying concern about aspirin's effects on gastritis.
