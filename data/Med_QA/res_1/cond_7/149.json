Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to different aspects of the patient's condition that collectively support the claim that alcohol use disorder is the most likely predisposing factor. For example, the MRI findings, repetitive questioning, cognitive impairment pattern, psychiatric manifestations, and living situation all overlap in pointing towards Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome caused by chronic alcohol use. Thus, there is a common semantic subset contributing to the support of the claim across all arguments.
