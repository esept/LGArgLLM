Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. All three arguments reference the patient's symptoms (stiffness, limited range of motion) and risk factors (sedentary lifestyle, obesity, age) that are consistent with subacromial bursitis. Since the justifications share common semantic subsets (e.g., symptoms and risk factors), they are not disjoint.
