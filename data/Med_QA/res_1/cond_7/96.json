Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided in the arguments are related to the claim that the findings are best explained by plague. They each address different aspects of the patient's symptoms and history that support the diagnosis of plague, such as the consistency of symptoms with pneumonic plague, the endemic region exposure, the characteristic bubo, systemic infection signs, and pulmonary involvement. Since all justifications contribute to the same conclusion (plague) and overlap in their support for the claim, none are semantically disjoint.
