Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the same semantic subset regarding the nature of confirmatory testing for HIV. They all discuss whether the confirmatory test determines the genotype of the virus or focuses on detecting HIV-specific antibodies. Thus, none of the pairs of arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
