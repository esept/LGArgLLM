Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets related to the role of cAMP in neurotransmitter release. For example, multiple arguments mention cAMP's involvement in synaptic signaling and its accumulation prior to neurotransmitter release, indicating overlap in their justifications. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
