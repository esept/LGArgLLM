Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the patient's symptoms and findings being more consistent with an opportunistic infection (PCP), while the second argument emphasizes the unlikelihood of a gag gene mutation given the patient's baseline viral load. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
