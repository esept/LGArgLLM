Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in discussing the patient's symptoms and their relation to haloperidol, but they diverge in their interpretations (acute dystonia vs. tardive dyskinesia or other movement disorders). For example, one argument focuses on the classic signs of acute dystonia, while another suggests tardive dyskinesia as a possible alternative. This semantic divergence means at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
