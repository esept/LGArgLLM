Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with the patient's condition, specifically mentioning lymphocytic infiltration, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and lymphocytic meningitis. These justifications overlap semantically as they all discuss EBV's role in causing conditions that match the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings. Therefore, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
