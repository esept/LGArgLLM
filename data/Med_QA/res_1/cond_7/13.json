Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct set of symptoms or findings (e.g., fatigue/weight gain, prior hyperthyroid state, delayed reflexes, vital signs) that independently support the likelihood of elevated TSH levels. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
