Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both arguments address the patient's symptoms and lab results to argue against aortic regurgitation, albeit from slightly different angles (one focuses on the symptoms being more consistent with uveitis, the other on the lack of typical causes for aortic regurgitation). Thus, they share a common semantic subset related to the patient's presentation not supporting aortic regurgitation.
