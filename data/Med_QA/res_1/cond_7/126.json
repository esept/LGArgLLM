Result: false
Justification: Both justifications for the arguments against hypothyroidism being the likely cause of the patient's condition are related to the lack of supporting evidence for hypothyroidism in the patient's history and lab results. They share a common semantic subset in that they both argue against hypothyroidism based on the absence of typical symptoms or lab findings, thus they are not disjoint.
