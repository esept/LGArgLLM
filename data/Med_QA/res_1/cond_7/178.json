Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments are related to the claim that marijuana is the most likely intoxication in the patient. They share common semantic subsets such as physical findings (conjunctival injection, dry mouth), physiological responses (tachycardia), and behavioral effects (anxiety, delayed responses) that are all associated with marijuana use. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
