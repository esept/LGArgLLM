Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification focuses on how standardized questionnaires minimize interviewer bias, the second highlights recall bias as more likely than interviewer bias, and the third discusses how interviewer awareness of ASD status could introduce bias. These justifications address different aspects of potential bias and do not share a common semantic subset with respect to the claim.
