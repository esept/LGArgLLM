Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the alignment of his aggressive actions with reaction formation, while another suggests his behavior might be due to societal conditioning rather than a psychological defense mechanism. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
