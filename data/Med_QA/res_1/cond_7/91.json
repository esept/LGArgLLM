Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. They all discuss the risks associated with elevated phenylalanine levels in women with PKU, particularly in the context of pregnancy, and how these levels can lead to adverse outcomes for the fetus. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all contribute to supporting the claim by highlighting the dangers of high phenylalanine levels during pregnancy.
