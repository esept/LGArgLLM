Let's analyze the semantic content of the justifications for each pair of arguments to determine if at least one pair is disjoint.

Arguments and their justifications:
1. A1: The spleen's white pulp (zone 3) contains lymphoid tissue responsible for immune responses against encapsulated bacteria like Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
2. A2: Splenic dysfunction, particularly in the white pulp, leads to impaired opsonization and phagocytosis of encapsulated bacteria, increasing susceptibility to infections.
3. A3: Patients with sickle-cell disease often develop functional asplenia due to infarcts, which compromises the immune functions of the white pulp (zone 3).
4. A4: The vaccines provided post-splenectomy target bacteria that are typically cleared by the spleen's white pulp, confirming its critical role in preventing these infections.
5. A5: Medical guidelines recommend vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria for patients with splenic dysfunction, underscoring the white pulp's role in immune defense.

Now, let's check for disjointness between pairs:

- A1 and A2: Both discuss the white pulp's role in immune defense against encapsulated bacteria (not disjoint).
- A1 and A3: Both mention the white pulp's immune functions (not disjoint).
- A1 and A4: Both relate white pulp to clearing specific bacteria (not disjoint).
- A1 and A5: Both connect white pulp to immune defense against these bacteria (not disjoint).
- A2 and A3: Both discuss dysfunction of white pulp leading to immune compromise (not disjoint).
- A2 and A4: Both relate white pulp dysfunction to susceptibility to these infections (not disjoint).
- A2 and A5: Both connect white pulp dysfunction to need for vaccinations (not disjoint).
- A3 and A4: Both relate white pulp function to infection prevention (not disjoint).
- A3 and A5: Both connect white pulp dysfunction to vaccination recommendations (not disjoint).
- A4 and A5: Both relate white pulp's role to vaccination needs (not disjoint).

All pairs share some common semantic subset related to the white pulp's role in immune defense against these specific bacteria. There are no pairs with completely disjoint justifications.

```
Result: false
Justification: All argument pairs share some semantic overlap regarding the white pulp's role in immune defense against encapsulated bacteria, with no completely disjoint pairs.
