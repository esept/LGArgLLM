Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the patient's symptoms (flushing, diarrhea, palpitations) and the elevated urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, which are classic indicators of carcinoid syndrome and neuroendocrine tumors, particularly in the adrenal medulla. None of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they all contribute to the same conclusion about the likely presence of an adrenal medullary mass.
