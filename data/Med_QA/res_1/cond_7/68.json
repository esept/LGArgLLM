Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the same semantic contentâ€”the drug's effect on cholesterol levels and the patient's risk of hypercholesterolemia. They overlap in discussing the drug's mechanism (SERM like raloxifene), its side effects (increased LDL cholesterol), and the patient's additional risk factors (hypertension and hydrochlorothiazide use). Since none of the justifications are semantically disjoint, the result is false.
