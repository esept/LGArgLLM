Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the mechanism of action of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and their effectiveness in treating GERD, particularly in cases where H2 blockers like cimetidine are inadequate. The justifications overlap in discussing the irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells as the most effective mechanism for reducing gastric acid secretion in GERD. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
