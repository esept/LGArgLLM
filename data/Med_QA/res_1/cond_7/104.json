Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, one argument focuses on the low blood pressure and high end-systolic volume, another on the systemic vascular resistance, and another on the unreliability of estimating ejection fraction without direct measurement. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
