Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the same core idea: that high sodium intake increases the risk of calcium oxalate stones and reducing sodium intake is a recommended intervention. They overlap semantically in supporting the claim by discussing the mechanism (increased urinary calcium excretion), the clinical recommendation, and the direct relevance to the patient's stone composition. Thus, no pair of justifications is disjoint.
