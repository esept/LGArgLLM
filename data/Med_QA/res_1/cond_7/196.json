Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments are related to the correct method of transporting the amputated finger, and they overlap in their support for the claim. Each justification provides a different reason why the method (wrapping in moist gauze, placing in a plastic bag, and putting on ice) is correct, but they all contribute to the same overall support for the claim. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
