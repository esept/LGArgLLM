Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the effectiveness of muscarinic antagonists in treating the patient's condition, based on allergic/asthmatic components, clinical practice, mechanism of action, and guidelines. They share common semantic subsets (e.g., relevance to allergic/asthmatic responses, clinical efficacy) that contribute to supporting the claim. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint.
