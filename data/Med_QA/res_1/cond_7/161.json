Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both reference the effectiveness of cladribine in treating hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and the patient's symptoms and immunophenotyping results that are classic for HCL. Similarly, the third argument discusses alternative treatments but still relates to the context of HCL treatment, overlapping with the other arguments. The fourth argument also overlaps by discussing the high complete response rate of cladribine in HCL. Thus, the justifications share common semantic subsets related to the claim.
