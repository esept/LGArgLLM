Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content, as they all support the claim by emphasizing the classic presentation of osteoarthritis and the lack of need for further work-up based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. For example, multiple arguments mention the absence of red flags, the typical symptoms of osteoarthritis, and the guidelines for clinical diagnosis without further testing. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
