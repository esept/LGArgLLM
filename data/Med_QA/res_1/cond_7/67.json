Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments all relate to the need for echocardiography based on the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, symptoms, and planned surgery. They share common semantic subsets such as evaluating cardiovascular disease, assessing cardiac function, and risk stratification, which contribute to supporting the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
