Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the same underlying diagnosis (polymyositis) and the likelihood of intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy. Each justification provides overlapping support for the claim by referencing different aspects of the patient's symptoms, lab results, and family history that collectively point to polymyositis. For example, the elevated inflammatory markers, proximal muscle weakness, and family history of autoimmune disease all contribute to the same conclusion, indicating semantic overlap.
