Result: false
Justification: All the arguments provided share a common semantic subset related to the mechanism of action of cilostazol as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE3). They all reference authoritative sources (medical literature, clinical guidelines, pharmacology textbooks, FDA) to support this claim, and none of the justifications are disjoint in meaning with respect to the claim.
