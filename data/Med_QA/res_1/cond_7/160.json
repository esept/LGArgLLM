Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both mention the involvement of cytotoxic T-cell mediated destruction in drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions due to ceftriaxone, indicating a semantic overlap. However, the third argument introduces a non-immune-mediated reaction, which is semantically disjoint from the other arguments as it does not involve cytotoxic T-cell destruction. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments (the third with any of the others) is disjoint.
