Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all three arguments share a common semantic subset: they all relate the occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) to the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum and the clinical presentation. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
