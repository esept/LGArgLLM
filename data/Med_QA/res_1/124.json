  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 63-year-old man is aiming to improve his health by eating a well balanced diet, walking daily, and quitting smoking following a 45-year smoking history. While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his calves that consistently appears after a mile of walking. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication is made. To improve his symptoms, cilostazol is prescribed.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Phosphodiesterase inhibitor is the mechanism of action of this medication.",
