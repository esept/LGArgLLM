Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core, which is the deficiency in the complement system, specifically C3b, as the likely cause of the patient's recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria. Each justification points to C3b's role as a critical opsonin and its impairment leading to the patient's clinical presentation, thus collectively supporting the claim.
