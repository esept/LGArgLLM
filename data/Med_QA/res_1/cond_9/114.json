Result: true  
Justification: All three P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim of subacromial bursitis. The justifications collectively highlight the patient's symptoms (stiffness, limited range of motion), risk factors (sedentary lifestyle, obesity, age), and the typical presentation of subacromial bursitis. These overlapping elements form a consistent basis for the diagnosis.
