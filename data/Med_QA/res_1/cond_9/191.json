Result: true  
Justification: All the provided P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification focuses on the effectiveness and appropriateness of ketotifen eye drops for treating allergic conjunctivitis, which is inferred from the patient's symptoms, seasonal pattern, and lack of current allergy treatment. The arguments consistently highlight the drug's mechanism of action, suitability for the patient's condition, and compatibility with existing medications, forming a unified basis for the claim.
