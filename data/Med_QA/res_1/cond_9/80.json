Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument suggests the symptoms are more consistent with an opportunistic infection, while the second argues that a gag gene mutation is unlikely due to the patient's previous responsiveness to HAART. These justifications address different aspects and do not intersect in supporting the claim about a gag gene mutation.
