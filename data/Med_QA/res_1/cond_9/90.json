Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not support the claim that the correct method for transport is to submerge the amputated finger in ice water. Instead, they collectively argue against this method, recommending alternative preservation techniques that avoid direct contact with ice water to prevent tissue damage. Therefore, there is no common semantic intersection supporting the claim.
