Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument supports SSRIs or SNRIs as first-line treatments for panic disorder, while the second argument highlights the inadequacy of lorazepam in addressing the patient's avoidance behavior. There is no intersection in their justifications that collectively supports the claim about lorazepam being the best medication for long-term management.
