Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments suggest that selective alpha-1 agonists can be used for bronchospasm (e.g., off-label use or adjunct therapy), others contradict this by stating that such drugs are atypical for asthma-related bronchospasm (e.g., beta-2 agonists are more common). The arguments do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
