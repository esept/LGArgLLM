Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification focuses on the long-term pain associated with inversion and eversion of the foot due to the calcaneal fracture and surgical repair. The arguments consistently highlight the biomechanical impact of the injury and surgery, the clinical evidence of persistent pain, and the stress on the calcaneus during movement, all of which directly support the claim.
