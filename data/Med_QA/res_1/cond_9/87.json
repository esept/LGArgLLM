Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that the right coronary artery (RCA) is the primary blood supply to the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum, which is the site of the transmural myocardial infarction in this patient. This consistent anatomical and physiological reasoning supports the claim that the RCA is most likely occluded.
