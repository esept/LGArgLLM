Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Some arguments (e.g., differentiating inflammatory arthritis, confirming synovitis) support the usefulness of synovial fluid analysis, while others (e.g., non-inflammatory condition, invasiveness, lack of systemic symptoms) argue against its necessity or prioritize other diagnostic tools. There is no intersection in meaning that universally supports the claim.
