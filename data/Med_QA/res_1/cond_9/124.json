Result: true  
Justification: All provided arguments consistently support the claim that cilostazol's mechanism of action is as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Each justification references authoritative sources (medical literature, clinical guidelines, pharmacology textbooks, FDA information) that confirm cilostazol's classification as a PDE3 inhibitor, leading to vasodilation and improved blood flow. The semantic core of all justifications is the same, reinforcing the claim with high confidence.
