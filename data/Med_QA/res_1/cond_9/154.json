Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. While some arguments (e.g., lymphoma causing pleural effusions, high protein and LDH levels) support the claim, others (e.g., congestive heart failure, other malignancies being more likely) contradict or provide alternative explanations. There is no intersection of meaning across all justifications that uniformly supports the claim.
