Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim that compression ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management. Each justification highlights the likelihood of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given the patient's risk factors (recent surgery, immobility, cancer diagnosis) and the unreliability of clinical signs to rule out DVT. They also emphasize the importance of early diagnosis to prevent complications like pulmonary embolism and the appropriateness of compression ultrasonography as the standard diagnostic test for DVT. The justifications collectively reinforce the necessity and appropriateness of compression ultrasonography in this clinical scenario.
