Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim. They all emphasize the necessity of echocardiography to evaluate cardiac structure and function, particularly in the context of the patient's symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue, fluid overload) and signs (elevated JVP, peripheral edema, enlarged cardiac silhouette). Each justification highlights different aspects of why echocardiography is the most appropriate next step, but they all converge on its diagnostic utility for cardiac pathology, especially heart failure.
