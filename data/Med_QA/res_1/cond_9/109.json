Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that the most likely underlying cause is an adverse effect of anesthetic. The first argument suggests a transfusion-transmitted infection like hepatitis as the cause, while the second argument points to another etiology like hepatitis B or C, both of which are unrelated to anesthesia. There is no intersection in their justifications that supports the claim about anesthetic effects.
