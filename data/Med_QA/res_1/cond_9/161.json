Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. The justifications consistently highlight that the patient's symptoms and lab results (splenomegaly, cytopenias, CD25 positivity) are indicative of hairy cell leukemia (HCL), for which cladribine is a highly effective first-line therapy with high complete response rates and durable remissions. While one argument mentions alternative treatments, it does not contradict the shared basis that cladribine is the most effective pharmacotherapy for this condition.
