Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Both arguments argue against the claim by stating that the clinical presentation is consistent with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) and that the treatment should be IVIG or plasmapheresis, not acyclovir. There is no intersection in the justifications that supports the claim of administering intravenous acyclovir.
