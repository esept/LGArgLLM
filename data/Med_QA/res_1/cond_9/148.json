Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. Instead, they collectively argue against the claim by emphasizing the need for immediate treatment (antibiotic therapy or targeted treatment) rather than further diagnostic imaging (bone scintigraphy). The justifications focus on the urgency of treating the infection and the redundancy of additional imaging after a confirmed diagnosis, which contradicts the claim's assertion about the appropriateness of bone scintigraphy.
