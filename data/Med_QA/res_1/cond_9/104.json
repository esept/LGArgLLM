Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. While some arguments (e.g., low blood pressure, high end-systolic volume, systemic vascular resistance) suggest a reduced ejection fraction, others (e.g., unreliability of estimation without direct measurement, tachycardia suggesting other causes) introduce uncertainty or alternative explanations. There is no single, shared semantic basis across all justifications that conclusively supports the claim of a 20% ejection fraction.
