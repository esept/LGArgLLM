Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that links the patient's symptoms, clinical findings, and occupational history to decreased lung compliance as the cause of increased expiratory flow rates. The justifications consistently point to restrictive lung disease (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease) as the underlying condition, which is characterized by reduced lung compliance and aligns with the observed expiratory flow rates.
