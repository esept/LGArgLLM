Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. They consistently highlight the patient's early-onset colonoscopies, family history of colon disease, and the likelihood of hereditary conditions like FAP, all of which align with autosomal dominant inheritance. The absence of evidence for other inheritance patterns further strengthens this shared basis.
