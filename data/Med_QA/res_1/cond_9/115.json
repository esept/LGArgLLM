Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that links the patient's symptoms (rotund abdomen, edema, chronic fatigue) and background (refugee from Somalia, food insecurity) to nutritional deficiencies, specifically mentioning or implying vitamin deficiencies as part of broader malnutrition. The justifications consistently point to protein-energy malnutrition (kwashiorkor) and its association with micronutrient deficiencies, including vitamins, as the underlying cause of the patient's condition.
