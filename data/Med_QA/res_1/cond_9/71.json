Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that calcium ion efflux is necessary for muscle cell relaxation, either by allowing sarcomeres to disengage, terminating actin-myosin interaction, lowering cytosolic calcium levels, or ceasing calcium-dependent activation of troponin. This consistent focus on calcium efflux as the direct necessary component for relaxation supports the claim.
