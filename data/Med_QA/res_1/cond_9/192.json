Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While most arguments suggest that α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is likely absent due to the cells being erythrocytes (which lack mitochondria), some arguments (e.g., A3 and A5) allow for the possibility that the cells might not be purely erythrocytes and could retain mitochondria and thus α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. This inconsistency means there is no universal intersection in the justifications supporting the claim.
