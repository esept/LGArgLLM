Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument suggests that the symptoms are more consistent with endometriosis, while the second argument points out that the patient's regular menses and normal hysterosalpingogram results indicate that infertility is not due to a structural issue like a myometrial tumor. These justifications do not intersect in supporting the claim about a smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium.
