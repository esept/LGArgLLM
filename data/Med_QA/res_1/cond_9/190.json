Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim. While some arguments (e.g., cAMP's role in synaptic plasticity and PKA activation) support the claim, others (e.g., the role of calcium and variability in timing) contradict or cast doubt on it. There is no intersection in meaning that universally supports the claim across all justifications.
