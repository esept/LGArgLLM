Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that the confirmatory test determines the genotype of the virus. Instead, they collectively argue that confirmatory tests (like ELISA and Western blot) focus on detecting HIV-specific antibodies and establishing the presence of HIV infection, not genotyping. Therefore, there is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
