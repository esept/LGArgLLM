Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that conjugation with a protein carrier enhances the immune response in infants by making the vaccine more immunogenic, stimulating helper T-cells, and providing clinical protection against Hib disease. Each argument supports this central idea, albeit with slightly different emphases (e.g., immunogenicity, T-cell response, clinical efficacy). The intersection is the improved infant immune response due to protein conjugation.
