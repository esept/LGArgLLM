Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim. Each justification emphasizes that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based, effective treatment for eating disorders like anorexia nervosa, which aligns with the patient's symptoms (denial of being underweight, refusal of medical interventions, and physical signs of an eating disorder). The arguments collectively highlight CBT's role in addressing cognitive distortions, maladaptive behaviors, and reducing relapse rates, all of which are directly relevant to the patient's condition and long-term management.
