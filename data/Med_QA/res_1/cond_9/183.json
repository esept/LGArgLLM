Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that interviewer bias is the most likely type of bias. The first justification argues that standardized questionnaires minimize interviewer bias, the second suggests recall bias is more likely, and the third acknowledges the possibility of interviewer bias if interviewers were aware of ASD status. These justifications do not collectively support the same semantic basis for the claim.
