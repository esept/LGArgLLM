Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument supports administering the meningococcal vaccine based on the patient's age and potential exposure risk, while the second argument opposes it by stating that the patient's age (31) may reduce the urgency for the vaccine. There is no intersection in meaning between these justifications.
