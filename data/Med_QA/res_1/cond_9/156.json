Result: true  
Justification: All the provided arguments consistently support the claim by pointing to polymyositis as the likely diagnosis, which is characterized by intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy. The justifications overlap in their focus on symptoms (progressive muscle weakness, dysphagia), lab findings (elevated CK, LDH, ESR), and clinical context (family history of autoimmune disease, absence of neuropathic signs), all of which align with polymyositis and thus the biopsy finding.
