Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that hyperplasia caused the observed change. Some arguments suggest that the changes are due to normal physiological adaptations (e.g., hormonal changes and preparation for lactation), while others argue that the changes may not be pathological hyperplasia. There is no consistent agreement on the cause being hyperplasia across all justifications.
