Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments support the claim by aligning his behavior with reaction formation (e.g., adopting opposite behaviors to true feelings, suppressing fantasies), others suggest alternative explanations (e.g., external influences, societal conditioning). The lack of a consistent semantic intersection across all justifications means they do not collectively support the same basis for the claim.
