Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that links selective alpha-1 agonists (like phenylephrine) to the treatment of nasal congestion caused by viral infections. Each justification supports the claim by reinforcing the connection between the drug's mechanism (vasoconstriction), the symptom (nasal congestion), and the likely etiology (viral infection).
