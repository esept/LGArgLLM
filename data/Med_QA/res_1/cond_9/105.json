Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic core that supports arterial thrombosis as the most common cause of the patient's condition. They collectively highlight the sudden onset of symptoms (pain, pallor, coolness), risk factors (hypertension, irregular pulse suggesting atrial fibrillation), physical findings (asymmetric pulses), and the exclusion of other causes (absence of smoking/alcohol use). These points consistently converge on arterial thrombosis as the most likely diagnosis.
