When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The man\"s actions are most consistent with the psychological defense mechanism of projection.",
