  "claim": "Consider the following background information: During a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, Th1 cells secrete a factor capable of stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages. In addition, the secreted factors help activate macrophages to produce mediators such as NO, which are capable of destroying the invading pathogen. Furthermore, activation of the macrophages by the secreted factor eventually leads to the formation of a tubercle.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: TNF-alpha is a factor secreted by Th1 cells and is responsible for these actions.",
