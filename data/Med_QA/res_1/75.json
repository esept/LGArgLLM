  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 14-year-old obese boy presents with severe right hip and knee pain. The patient says that he has been limping with mild pain for the past three weeks, but the pain acutely worsened today. He describes the pain as severe, non-radiating, sharp and aching in character, and localized to the right hip and knee joints. The patient denies recent illness, travel, trauma, or similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history and no current medications. The patient is not sexually active and denies any alcohol, smoking or drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The right leg is externally rotated, and there is a limited range of motion in the right hip. Strength is 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint and 5 out of 5 elsewhere. There is no tenderness to palpation. No joint erythema, edema or effusion present. Sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Surgical pinning of the right hip is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient.",
