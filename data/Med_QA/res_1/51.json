The patient has not been able to eat or drink due to the pain and has been irritable. The patient also reports muscle aches. His vital signs are as follows: T 39.1, HR 110, BP 90/62, RR 18, SpO2 99%. Physical examination is significant for vesicular lesions noted on the tongue, gingiva, and lips, with some vesicles having ruptured and ulcerated, as well as palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely causative organism in this patient\"s presentation is CMV .",
