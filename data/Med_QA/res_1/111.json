  "claim": "Consider the following background information: Please refer to the summary above to answer this question The authors of the study have decided to conduct a follow-up analysis on their data. They decide to stratify their results by CD4+T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36).\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The difference observed between the two strata can be explained by effect modification.",
