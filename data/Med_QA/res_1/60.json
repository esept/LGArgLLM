  "claim": "Consider the following background information: An 80-year-old African American man is brought to the emergency department in a confused state with history of general illness for the past week. He is known to be hypertensive, but noncompliant with medications for the last 20 years. Physical examination reveals dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, heart rate is 89/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. The initial laboratory results are remarkable for hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 90 \u03bcm3, platelet count of 200,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 29 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: An Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor is the best initial management for this patient\"s condition.",
