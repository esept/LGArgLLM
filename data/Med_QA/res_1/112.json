  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent fevers for the past 6 months. He has had sexual intercourse with multiple men and women over the past year and does not use barrier protection. His last screen for sexually transmitted diseases was 10 years ago and was normal. His past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. He was involved in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago and suffered multiple fractured bones in his upper and lower extremities, all of which have healed. He has a distant history of cocaine abuse. He drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week. His temperature is 100.8\u00b0F (38.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, he appears cachectic but is pleasant and appropriately interactive. An HIV differentiation assay and follow-up Western blot are performed and are positive. The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient is at greatest risk for developing megaloblastic anemia as a result of the change in medication regimen.",
