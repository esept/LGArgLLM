  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 10-year-old girl is brought to a clinic by her parents after 1 week of difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers. She has also developed shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth. There is no history of chills, rigors, or headaches. Her appetite has decreased. The girl has been HIV-positive since birth and is being treated with HAART. Her baseline viral load is <50/mL. On general examination, the girl appears ill. Diffuse inspiratory crackles are heard on chest auscultation with normal heart sounds. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly is noted on physical examination. A blood sample is drawn, which shows a CD4 count of 100/mm3 and a viral load of 25,050/mL.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy in this patient is a gag gene mutation.",
