The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s symptoms are best explained by damage to the left frontal lobe.",
