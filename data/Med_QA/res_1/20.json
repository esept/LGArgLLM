One of the agents studied is a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The investigator determines that inactivating this virus can prevent its spread.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Sodium hypochlorite is the most effective disinfectant for inactivating this virus.",
