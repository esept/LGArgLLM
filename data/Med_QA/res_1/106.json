  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife due to abdominal distension and persistent somnolence for the past 2 weeks. The patient\u2019s wife says that he has been sleeping much more than usual for the past 5 days. His bowel and bladder habit have not changed. His past medical history is significant for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. His vital signs include: pulse 76/min, respiratory rate 15/min, temperature 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and blood pressure 122/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is altered and not responsive to commands. Oriented x 0. The abdomen is significantly distended. Shifting dullness is present and a positive fluid wave can be elicited. Hyperreflexia and asterixis are noted. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Laboratory test Sodium 140 mEq/L Potassium 3.5 mEq/L Chloride 97 mEq/L Glucose 90 mg/dL Ammonia 100 \u00b5g/dL (ref: 19-60 \u00b5g/dL) Arterial blood gas pH 7.4 pCO2 40 mm Hg pO2 90 mm Hg HCO3 26 mEq/L An abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Portal vein thrombosis is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient\u2019s condition.",
