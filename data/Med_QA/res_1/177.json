Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. She has a history of a seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The child is at greatest risk of developing teeth discoloration.",
