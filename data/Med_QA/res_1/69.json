  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 52-year-old woman presents with a complaint of headache for the past 10 days. Her headache is diffuse, dull in character, moderate in intensity, and is worse in the morning. It is not associated with fever and sensitivity to light or sound. She experiences occasional nausea but no vomiting. She did not have similar headaches in the past. Her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg; pulse, 60/min, and body mass index is 33.5 kg/m2. The neurological examination reveals normal extraocular movements. Mild bilateral papilledema is present. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain reveals a solitary lesion in the left temporal region with predominant hemorrhage. Refer to the image below of the MRI of the brain.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Multiple myeloma is the type of cancer that has the highest tendency to cause this brain lesion.",
