Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not contain justifications that semantically subsume the minimal support from S-type arguments. Specifically, S-type arguments highlight that the 1-hour timeframe is too short for G2 phase effects and that endometrial cells may have additional regulatory mechanisms. These critical limitations are not addressed or contained within the justifications of the P-type arguments, which focus on CDK4's role in G1/S progression and indirect effects on G2, without countering the specific temporal and tissue-context constraints raised by the S-type arguments.
