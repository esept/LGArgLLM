Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that GBS is the correct diagnosis and treatment should be IVIG/plasmapheresis, not acyclovir. The S-type arguments provide support by explaining why acyclovir is inappropriate (not indicated for GBS, CSF findings don't support viral infection). However, none of the S-type arguments' justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications; rather, they provide complementary reasons against acyclovir use. The S-type arguments do not contain minimal semantic bases that are subsets of the P-type justifications.
