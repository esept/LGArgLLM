**Result:** false  
**Justification:**  
The S-type arguments (S1 and S2) both challenge the necessity of sputum culture by suggesting alternative explanations (non-infectious etiology, asthma/reactive airway disease). Their justifications are not semantic subsets of any P-type argument’s justification, which all emphasize identifying infectious causes. Since no S-type argument supports the claim by providing a semantic subset of a P-type argument’s justification, C11 is not satisfied.
