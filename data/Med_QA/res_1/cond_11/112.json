Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments state that the patient's symptoms and history do not support megaloblastic anemia risk, and the S-type arguments confirm that the medications involved (tenofovir, efavirenz, ritonavir) are not known to cause megaloblastic anemia. However, C11 requires that for every minimal semantic basis of the claim, there exists a P-type argument whose justification contains that basis. Here, the claim's basis involves medication change causing megaloblastic anemia, but no P-type argument's justification contains support for this risk; instead, all arguments refute it.
