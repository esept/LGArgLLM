Result: false  
Justification: There is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of any P-type argument's justification and contributes to supporting the claim. The S-type arguments challenge the BPD diagnosis by suggesting alternative explanations (normal grief) or noting insufficient criteria, rather than providing semantic subsets that support the claim.
