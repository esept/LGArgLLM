**Result: false**  
**Justification:** The S-type arguments provide reasons why methylprednisolone might *not* be prescribed (e.g., incomplete recovery with corticosteroids, diabetes concerns, need for alternative therapies), and none of their justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type justifications, which focus on reasons *for* prescribing methylprednisolone. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
