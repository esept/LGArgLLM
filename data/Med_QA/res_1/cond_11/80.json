Result: false  
Justification: No P-type argument's justification contains the entire semantic basis from any S-type argument as a subset; the P arguments focus on alternative explanations (opportunistic infection, previous HAART response) without fully encompassing the S arguments' reasoning about infectious etiology, pediatric rarity, adherence, or opportunistic infection prevalence.
