Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide semantic subsets that challenge the claim by pointing to inconsistencies (e.g., lack of pain, presence of weakness, and alternative diagnoses like adhesive capsulitis), but none of the P-type arguments' justifications fully contain these critical semantic elements. Therefore, not every minimal semantic basis for the claim is covered by a P-type argument.
