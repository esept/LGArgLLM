Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide reasons that challenge or complicate the claim by introducing confounding factors (e.g., existing medications, age/postmenopausal status, lack of baseline lipid data), but they do not offer semantic subsets that support the claim. The P-type arguments justify the claim by linking the drug to increased LDL/hypercholesterolemia risk, but the S-type arguments do not contain justifications that are subsets reinforcing this link; instead, they undermine it.
