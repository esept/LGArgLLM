Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments do not contain justifications that semantically subsume the S-type arguments' justifications. Specifically, the S-type arguments provide reasons against portal vein thrombosis (e.g., no ultrasound evidence, stable vitals), while the P-type arguments either support portal hypertension (possibly from thrombosis) or argue against thrombosis by favoring hepatic encephalopathy. There is no P-type argument whose justification includes the S-type arguments' content as a subset supporting the claim.
