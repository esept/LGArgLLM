Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide alternative diagnostic considerations (COPD, non-invasive tests, GERD/pulmonary issues) that challenge the necessity of angiography as the immediate next step. These arguments represent plausible minimal semantic bases for the claim that angiography is the next step, but the P-type arguments do not contain these alternative justificationsâ€”instead, they focus solely on cardiac indications. Therefore, not all minimal semantic bases (represented by S arguments) are contained within the justifications of the P arguments.
