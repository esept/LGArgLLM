Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide reasons against EBV being the cause (e.g., absence of fever, normal labs, alternative explanations), and none of their justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications that support the claim. Instead, they contradict or weaken the support for EBV association.
