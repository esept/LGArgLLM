Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments include one (P4) that opposes the claim by suggesting alternative explanations for decreased arginine concentrations (e.g., urea cycle or protein synthesis), and there is no support argument whose justification is a semantic subset of P4's justification that contributes to supporting the claim. Therefore, not every minimal semantic basis of the claim is contained within the justification of at least one P-type argument.
