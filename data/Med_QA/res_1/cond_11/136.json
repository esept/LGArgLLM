Justification: All three P-type arguments provide justifications that contain the minimal semantic basis linking fibrates (the most likely prescribed drug given the lipid effects) to decreased vitamin D absorption through bile acid metabolism interference, and each S-type argument does not contradict this basis but rather discusses alternative explanations or uncertainties that do not undermine the core relationship.
