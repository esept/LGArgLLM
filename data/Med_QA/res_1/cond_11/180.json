Result: false  
Justification: The claim states that nasal congestion is the drug prescribed due to a viral infection, which is factually incorrect (nasal congestion is a symptom, not a drug). However, even ignoring this, the P-type arguments do not contain justifications that are semantic supersets of all possible minimal support sets for the claim. Specifically, the S-type arguments highlight that improvement in symptoms and absence of adverse effects do not confirm a viral cause, and nasal congestion can have non-viral origins. No P-type argument's justification semantically encompasses all these counterpoints, failing to satisfy C11.
