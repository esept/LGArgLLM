Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments' justifications do not contain any S-type justification as a semantic subset. Instead, the P arguments argue against the claim by suggesting endometriosis, while the S arguments also refute the claim by pointing out inconsistencies with a smooth muscle tumor. No P argument's justification includes a minimal semantic support basis for the claim itself.
