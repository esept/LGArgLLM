Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide reasons that challenge the claim by highlighting diagnostic uncertainty and patient-specific factors that may affect therapy choice, but no S-type argument's justification is a semantic subset of any P-type argument's justification that supports the claim. Additionally, the P-type arguments do not collectively cover all minimal semantic bases for the claim, as they do not address the diagnostic uncertainty or individual patient factors raised by the S-type arguments.
