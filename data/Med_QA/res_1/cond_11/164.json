Result: true  
Justification: All three P-type arguments provide overlapping justifications that collectively cover the key features (hard hypoechogenic mass, vascular invasion, papillary thyroid carcinoma as most likely diagnosis) which are the minimal semantic basis for the claim about psammoma bodies. Each P argument's justification contains the necessary elements linking clinical findings to papillary carcinoma where psammoma bodies are characteristic.
