Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications contain a semantic subset of the S-type arguments' justifications that would support the claim. In fact, all P-type arguments argue against reducing the insulin dose, while the claim asserts it is the optimal intervention. The S-type arguments also support the position that reducing insulin dose is not appropriate, further contradicting the claim.
