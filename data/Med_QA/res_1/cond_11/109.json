Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments argue against the claim that the cause is an adverse effect of anesthetic, instead favoring transfusion-transmitted hepatitis. However, the S-type arguments also oppose the claim and provide supporting reasons (e.g., symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis, timing not typical for anesthetic effects). Since both P and S arguments collectively undermine the claim, there is no P-type argument whose justification contains a semantic subset from S-type arguments that supports the claim.
