Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide counterpoints or limitations to the claim that sodium hypochlorite is the most effective disinfectant, rather than supporting fragments of minimal semantic support sets for the claim. Since no S-type argument's justification is a semantic subset of any P-type argument's justification that contributes to supporting the claim, C11 is not satisfied.
