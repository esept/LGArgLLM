Result: false  
Justification: The condition C11 requires that for every minimal semantic basis of the claim, there exists at least one P-type argument whose justification contains that basis. However, the P-type arguments here focus on reasons why bone scintigraphy is not appropriate (e.g., need for immediate treatment, confirmed diagnosis, infectious etiology), but none of their justifications contain or subsume the minimal semantic support sets that would be needed to establish bone scintigraphy as the most appropriate next step. The S-type arguments also oppose the claim, and no P-type argument supports it.
