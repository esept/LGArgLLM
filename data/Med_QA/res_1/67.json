  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 67-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine medical check-up prior to a scheduled elective femoropopliteal bypass surgery of his left leg. He feels well but reports occasional episodes of weakness and numbness in his left hand. He has a history of peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gout. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He drinks 3 cans of beer daily. His current medications include aspirin, metformin, enalapril, simvastatin, and febuxostat. His temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Auscultation of the right side of the neck shows a bruit. There is a right-sided reducible inguinal hernia. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference ranges. An electrocardiogram shows signs of mild left ventricular hypertrophy. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Echocardiography is the most appropriate next step in management.",
