  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 21-year-old woman presents with sudden onset of high blood pressure. She is concerned about her health especially after her colleagues noticed that her face gets red at times while at work. She has even started to use blankets to cover her feet, even on the warmest days in the summer, even though her hands feel warm to the touch. She is a student who exercises and eats a well-balanced diet every day. There is no family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes. On examination, her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, respirations are 19/min, pulse is 64/min, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). An echocardiogram is ordered for investigation.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Turner syndrome is likely the condition affecting this patient.",
