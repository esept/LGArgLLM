  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 48-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Two weeks ago, while visiting Guatemala, she had an emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia. During the surgery, she received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Her temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F) and blood pressure is 138/76 mm Hg. Examination shows jaundice and tender hepatomegaly. Serum studies show: Alkaline phosphatase 102 U/L Aspartate aminotransferase 760 U/L Bilirubin Total 3.8 mg/dL Direct 3.1 mg/dL Anti-HAV IgG positive Anti-HAV IgM negative Anti-HBs positive HBsAg negative Anti-HCV antibodies negative Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The most likely underlying cause of this patient\"s condition is an adverse effect of anesthetic.",
