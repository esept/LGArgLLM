  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour. Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient\"s pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta. The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, during which her blood pressure decreases from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Uterine artery ligation is the best next step in management.",
