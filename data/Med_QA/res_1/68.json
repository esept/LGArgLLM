  "claim": "Consider the following background information: An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman is found to have T-score of -2.6 SD on routine bone mineral density screening. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago and treated with medroxyprogesterone. Menarche started at 11 years of age and her last menstrual period was 8 years ago. Her last mammography and PAP smear 6 months ago showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not have any children. Current medications include lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment is begun with a drug that prevents further bone resorption and reduces her risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: This drug puts her at an increased risk of hypercholesterolemia.",
