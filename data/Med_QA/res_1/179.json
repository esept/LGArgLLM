  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:  Serum: Na+: 142 mEq/L Cl-: 102 mEq/L K+: 3.9 mEq/L HCO3-: 25 mEq/L BUN: 20 mg/dL Glucose: 314 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL Ca2+: 10.1 mg/dL AST: 9 U/L ALT: 8 U/L 24-hour urinary cortisol: 470 \u00b5g (< 300 \u00b5g) Serum cortisol 30 \u00b5g/mL (5-23 \u00b5g/dL) Serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)  A 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The best next step in management is to perform a low dose dexamethasone suppression test.",
