She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. Current medications include glyburide and amlodipine. The physician prescribes a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: The patient\"s prescribed drug is likely to cause changes in bradykinin concentration in the serum.",
