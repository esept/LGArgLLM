  "claim": "Consider the following background information: A 55-year-old man presents with bloody nasal secretions and shortness of breath. He reports he has lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) in the last two months with no changes in his diet. He has also been suffering from mild to moderate joint pain in the left knee for the last year. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vitals include: blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, temperature 37.0\u2103 (98.6\u2109), pulse 70/min, respiratory rate 14/min. Physical examination is significant for nasal ulcers. Diffuse crackles are present over all lobes of the lung bilaterally. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL Hematocrit 37.7% Leukocyte count 5500/mm3 Neutrophils 65% Lymphocytes 30% Monocytes 5% Mean corpuscular volume 82.2 \u03bcm3 Platelet count 190,000/mm3 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 35 mm/h C-reactive protein 14 mg/dL Creatinine 3.09 mg/dL The patient is prescribed a corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics but returns in 2 weeks without any clinical improvement.\n\nGiven the background information the following is corrrect: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies would most likely confirm the diagnosis in this patient.",
