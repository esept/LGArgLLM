Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument advocates for SSRIs or SNRIs as first-line treatments for panic disorder, emphasizing their efficacy and safety profile. The second argument focuses on the patient's avoidance behavior and the need for therapy, which lorazepam does not address. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim about lorazepam being the best medication for long-term management.
