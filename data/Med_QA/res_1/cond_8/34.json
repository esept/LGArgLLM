Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim that decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient. Each argument discusses the relationship between decreased adiposity and lower estrogen levels, either through the role of adipose tissue in estrogen production, the clinical presentation of hypoestrogenemia, or the physiological mechanisms linking low body fat to hypoestrogenemia. The overlap in meaning is clear across all pairs of arguments.
