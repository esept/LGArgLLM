Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms (holosystolic murmur, feeding difficulties, listlessness) are consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or other cardiac defects associated with 22q11 deletion syndrome. Additionally, they all address why certain findings (e.g., absence of cyanosis, normal APGAR score, lack of maternal medical history) do not rule out this diagnosis. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps semantically in supporting the claim.
