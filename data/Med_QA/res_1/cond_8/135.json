Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the patient's thin appearance and temporal wasting as evidence of malnutrition, suggesting a dietary deficiency (e.g., vitamin C) rather than a genetic defect in lysine synthesis. The second argument highlights the patient's living alone and recent bereavement as factors increasing the likelihood of poor dietary intake, supporting a nutritional cause like vitamin C deficiency. While both arguments point to a nutritional cause, they do so based on different aspects of the patient's condition (physical signs vs. social circumstances), and neither directly addresses the claim about defective synthesis of a substance composed primarily of lysine. Therefore, there is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in their justifications that supports the claim.
