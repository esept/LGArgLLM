Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to signs of malnutrition (e.g., rotund abdomen, edema, chronic fatigue) and links these to broader nutritional deficiencies, including vitamins. The arguments also consistently reference the patient's background (e.g., refugee status, food insecurity in Somalia) as a risk factor for such deficiencies. Thus, there is a common theme of nutritional deficiency, particularly involving vitamins, across all justifications.
