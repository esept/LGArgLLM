Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the patient's symptoms (fatigue, weakness, weight loss, hypotension, hyperpigmentation) are indicative of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), which necessitates immediate treatment with both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Each argument reinforces this central idea, either by emphasizing specific symptoms, the urgency of treatment, or the exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Thus, all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
