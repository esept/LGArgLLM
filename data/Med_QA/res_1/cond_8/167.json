Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the role of the spleen's white pulp (zone 3) in immune responses against encapsulated bacteria, the consequences of its dysfunction (such as impaired opsonization and phagocytosis), and the relevance to sickle-cell disease and post-splenectomy care. The common themes of immune function, encapsulated bacteria, and clinical implications ensure semantic overlap across all pairs.
