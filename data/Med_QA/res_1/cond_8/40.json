Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to the claim. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the patient's symptoms and history in relation to a systolic ejection murmur. The third and fourth arguments both consider the patient's physical characteristics and absence of certain conditions in relation to the murmur. The fifth argument ties the patient's vital signs to the audibility of the murmur, which overlaps with the hemodynamic considerations in other arguments. Thus, all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications supporting the claim.
