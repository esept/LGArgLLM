Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic justification related to the patient's laboratory findings and their interpretation as indicative of a recent or current hepatitis A infection. Each argument either discusses the significance of specific serological markers (Anti-HAV IgM and IgG), rules out other infections, or aligns the findings with the patient's travel history and lack of symptoms. The overlapping idea is that the serological profile best fits a recent hepatitis A infection.
