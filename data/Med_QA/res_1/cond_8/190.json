Result: false
Justification: While some arguments share common ideas about cAMP's role in neurotransmitter release (e.g., A1 and A2 both mention cAMP's role in synaptic plasticity or activation of adenylyl cyclase), other arguments introduce conflicting or distinct ideas (e.g., A3 and A4 mention calcium's role or variability in timing, which are not overlapping with the other justifications). Therefore, not all pairs share semantic intersections in their justifications.
