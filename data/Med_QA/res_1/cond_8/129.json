Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share semantic intersections in their justifications. The first argument discusses the timing of symptoms aligning with potential complications from an improperly administered injection, which is related to the second argument's focus on the absence of redness or swelling making it less likely the symptoms are directly related to the vaccination itself. Both relate to the third argument's description of the specific gait abnormality being consistent with sciatic nerve injury, which can occur if the vaccine is injected too close to the nerve. Thus, all arguments overlap in discussing the potential for improper injection leading to the observed symptoms.
