Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument cites the patient's history of a heart attack, current symptoms (dyspnea, orthopnea), and the likelihood of underlying coronary artery disease or heart failure as reasons for angiography being the next step. The common themes of ischemic heart disease and the diagnostic utility of angiography are present in all justifications.
