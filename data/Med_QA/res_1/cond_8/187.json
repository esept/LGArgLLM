Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that a fractured and surgically repaired calcaneus (especially with multiple screws) leads to long-term pain during inversion and eversion of the foot. The justifications overlap in their reasoning about the biomechanical impact of the injury and surgery, clinical evidence of persistent pain, and the stress the calcaneus bears during movement. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
