Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why submerging the amputated finger in ice water is incorrect, but they do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern beyond this general theme. The first argument cites medical guidelines, the second mentions frostbite, and the third discusses proper preservation techniques. While all oppose the claim, their justifications are distinct and do not intersect semantically.
