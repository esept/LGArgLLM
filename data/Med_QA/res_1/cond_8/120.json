Result: false
Justification: The arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why the confirmatory test does not determine the genotype of the virus (e.g., genotyping is for treatment decisions, standard tests detect antibodies, the goal is to establish infection). There is no common idea or proposition shared among all pairs of arguments.
