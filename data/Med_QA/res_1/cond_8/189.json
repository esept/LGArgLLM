Result: false
Justification: While most arguments share semantic overlap in discussing reaction formation or external influences, the third argument ("His actions may stem from external influences like peer pressure or indoctrination by the hate group, rather than an internal psychological defense mechanism.") introduces a distinct reasoning pattern that contradicts the others by attributing the behavior solely to external factors without acknowledging psychological mechanisms. This creates a pair (third argument with any other) that lacks semantic intersection regarding the defense mechanism.
