Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. While some arguments focus on the need for surgical intervention like uterine artery ligation due to failed conservative measures and hemodynamic instability, others suggest alternatives like uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy, or prioritize uterotonics before surgical options. These justifications do not all intersect on a common idea or reasoning pattern supporting the claim.
