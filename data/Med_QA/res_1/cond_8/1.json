Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms are consistent with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is caused by anterior horn cell degeneration. Each argument either directly references SMA or describes symptoms and clinical findings that are characteristic of SMA, thereby supporting the claim that anterior horn cell degeneration is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The semantic overlap is clear as all justifications revolve around the same underlying condition and its manifestations.
