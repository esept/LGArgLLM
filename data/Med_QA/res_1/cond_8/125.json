Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that ceftriaxone is the appropriate treatment for the patient due to the risk of infection (particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) in the context of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. Each argument either directly references the patient's cirrhosis, altered mental status, or potential infection as justification for using ceftriaxone, and all align with clinical guidelines supporting its use in this scenario. The overlapping semantic justifications are clear across all pairs of arguments.
