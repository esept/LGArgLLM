Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that compression ultrasonography is the appropriate next step due to the high likelihood of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in this patient, given her recent surgery, immobility, and cancer diagnosis. Each argument either directly supports the necessity of compression ultrasonography for diagnosing DVT or indirectly supports it by ruling out alternative diagnoses or emphasizing the risks of untreated DVT. The semantic overlap is clear as all justifications revolve around the clinical indication for compression ultrasonography in this context.
