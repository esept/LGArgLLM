Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the impact of ATP2A1 gene mutations on the SERCA1 calcium ATPase pump's function, leading to impaired calcium reuptake, prolonged muscle relaxation, and increased cytosolic calcium concentration. The justifications consistently reference these core ideas, ensuring semantic overlap across all pairs.
