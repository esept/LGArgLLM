Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument ties the patient's symptoms (stiffness, difficulty with certain movements), risk factors (sedentary lifestyle, obesity, age), and the typical presentation of subacromial bursitis to support the claim that this is the most likely diagnosis. The common ideas include the patient's symptoms being consistent with subacromial bursitis, the patient's lifestyle and age being risk factors, and the condition being common in older adults. Thus, all pairs of arguments share semantic intersections.
