Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the patient's symptoms (persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, RSV pneumonia, failure to thrive) are indicative of defective T cell function, particularly in the context of a primary immunodeficiency disorder like SCID. Each justification reinforces this central theme by highlighting different aspects of T cell dysfunction and its clinical manifestations, ensuring semantic overlap between all pairs of arguments.
