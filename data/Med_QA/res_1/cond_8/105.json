Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument points to different aspects of the patient's condition (sudden onset of symptoms, hypertension, irregular pulse, asymmetry in pulses, absence of other risk factors, age) that collectively support arterial thrombosis as the most common cause. The justifications consistently reference clinical signs and risk factors that are commonly associated with arterial thrombosis, ensuring semantic overlap between all pairs.
