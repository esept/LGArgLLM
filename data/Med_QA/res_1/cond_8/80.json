Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the patient's symptoms being more consistent with an opportunistic infection like PCP, while the second argument emphasizes the patient's previous responsiveness to HAART as evidence against a gag gene mutation. These justifications address different aspects of the claim and do not intersect in meaning.
