Result: true
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic justification related to alcohol use disorder being the most likely predisposing factor for the patient's condition. Each argument points to different clinical and radiological findings (MRI findings, memory deficits, cognitive patterns, psychiatric manifestations, living situation) that are all associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is strongly linked to chronic alcohol use disorder. Thus, there is an overlap in the underlying reasoning that ties each argument back to the claim.
