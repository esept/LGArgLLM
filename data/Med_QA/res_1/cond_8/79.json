Result: true
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic theme related to the pharmacological properties of class I anti-arrhythmic drugs and their known side effects, specifically headache and tinnitus at high doses. Each justification references the drug's mechanism of action (sodium and potassium channel blockade) and its clinical effects, which overlap in meaning and support the claim.
