Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument states that VDJ recombination is specific to immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, the second suggests the sequence is part of a pattern recognition mechanism, and the third emphasizes that VDJ recombination occurs in lymphocyte development, not in mature immune cells. These are distinct points without semantic overlap.
