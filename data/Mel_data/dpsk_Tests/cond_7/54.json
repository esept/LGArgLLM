Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support for the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that AI systems are designed or programmed to follow human instructions (e.g., "core functionality relies on obeying human commands" and "operate under predefined constraints"). Additionally, several arguments reference ethical or legal reasons for AI compliance (e.g., "alignment with human values" and "legal liability concerns"). These shared semantic elements mean that no pair of arguments is completely disjoint with respect to the claim.
