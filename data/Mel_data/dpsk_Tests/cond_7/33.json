Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and third arguments both refer to the defensive use of the porcupine's tail in response to predators, and the second and fourth arguments both discuss the tail's role as a primary defense mechanism due to its anatomical features. There is overlap in the semantic content supporting the claim.
