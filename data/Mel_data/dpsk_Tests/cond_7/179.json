Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the safety of nuclear power (e.g., lower fatality rates, advanced safety features, waste management, radiation exposure, historical data, and international agency affirmations). None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
