Given the arguments provided, let's analyze their justifications with respect to the claim.

Arguments:
1. A1: "Historical price trends of gold show cyclical patterns, suggesting that periods of increase are often followed by periods of decrease."
   - Justification: Historical cyclical patterns in gold prices.
2. A2: "Economic theory suggests that asset prices cannot rise indefinitely without correction, implying a future decline after a sustained increase."
   - Justification: Economic theory on asset price corrections.

Analysis:
- A1's justification is based on empirical historical data about gold's price cycles.
- A2's justification is based on general economic principles about asset prices.

These justifications do not share a common semantic subset; one is specific to gold's history, and the other is a general economic principle. They support the claim from different angles without overlapping in meaning.

Result: true
Justification: The justifications of A1 and A2 are semantically disjoint as they rely on different types of evidence (historical data vs. economic theory) to support the claim.
