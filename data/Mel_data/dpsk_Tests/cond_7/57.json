Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., lack of empirical evidence, lack of endorsement by mainstream institutions, inconsistent study results, contradiction with scientific principles, regulatory approval requirements, placebo effect) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning.
