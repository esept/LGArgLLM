Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both discuss the impracticality of pure black clothing for stealth, with the first mentioning historical records and the second explaining the contrast issue. Similarly, the third and fourth arguments both reference the practicality of muted or natural colors for blending into environments. These overlaps indicate shared semantic subsets contributing to the support of the claim.
