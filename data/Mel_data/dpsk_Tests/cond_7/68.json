Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content, as they all refer to the lack of scientific evidence or biological plausibility for curing diseases through touch. For example, multiple arguments mention the absence of medical evidence (A1 and A4) or the need for specific medical interventions (A2 and A5). Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
