Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (per capita consumption, cultural traditions, market share of alternative beverages, preference for tea) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
