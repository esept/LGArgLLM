Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided are related to the claim that Nixon's statement "I am not a crook" was in reference to the Watergate scandal. They overlap in their support of the claim by providing historical context, public interpretation, and direct evidence linking the statement to the scandal. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
