Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint, as some share overlapping themes (e.g., rising food costs and wage stagnation). However, at least one pair (e.g., arguments about food insecurity rates and supply chain disruptions) are semantically distinct in their justifications with respect to the claim, as they address different aspects of the issue without overlapping reasoning.
