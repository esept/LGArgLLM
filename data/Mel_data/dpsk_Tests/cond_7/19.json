Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., Gini coefficient, middle class size, poverty rates, taxation policies, historical economic policies, labor market opportunities) to support the claim, and none of these reasons overlap in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
