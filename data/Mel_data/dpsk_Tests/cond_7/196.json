Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all arguments share a common semantic theme: they all assert that mirrors lack any inherent properties or mechanisms to cause observable effects, whether physical, psychological, or supernatural. Since none of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim, the result is false.
