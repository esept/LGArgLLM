Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint, as they all share a common theme of lack of evidence or scientific basis for the medicinal efficacy of pangolin scales. However, since the task requires checking if at least one pair is disjoint, and all pairs here overlap in their support of the claim, the correct answer is false. But based on the given arguments, all justifications are related in supporting the claim, so no pair is disjoint.

Correction: 

Upon re-reading the task, the correct interpretation is that if **all** pairs are **not** disjoint (i.e., all justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim), then the result is False. Since all the justifications here overlap in supporting the claim (lack of evidence, scientific basis, or recognition), no pair is disjoint. Thus:

```
Result: false
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping justifications supporting the claim (e.g., lack of scientific evidence, absence of therapeutic properties, or lack of recognition by medical organizations). Thus, no pair is semantically disjoint.
