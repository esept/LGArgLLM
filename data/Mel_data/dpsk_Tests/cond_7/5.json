Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., tourism rankings, airport traffic, government statistics, international events, business travel, cultural landmarks) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning.
