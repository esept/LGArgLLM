Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why no machine has been shown to rigorously detect all kinds of lies, such as reliance on physiological responses, lack of perfect accuracy in machine learning models, absence of scientific validation, inability to interpret nuanced cues, and lack of peer-reviewed evidence for distinguishing all forms of lies. None of the justifications overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
