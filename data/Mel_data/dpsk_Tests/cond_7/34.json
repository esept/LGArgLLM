Result: true
Justification: The justifications for each argument describe distinct mechanisms or dietary approaches (e.g., Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, intermittent fasting, plant-based diets, ketogenic diet, Volumetrics diet) that contribute to weight loss. None of the justifications share a common semantic subset with respect to the claim, as each presents a unique scientific basis or dietary strategy. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
