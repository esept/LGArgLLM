Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Baumeister's experimental results, the second on meta-analyses of ego depletion studies, and the third on neuroscientific evidence. While all support the claim, they do so through distinct lines of reasoning without overlapping semantic content.
