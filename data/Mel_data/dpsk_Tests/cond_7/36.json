Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments discuss the concept of entrapment in U.S. law and how it relates to prosecution for crimes committed under police inducement. They share a common semantic subset that contributes to supporting the claim, focusing on different aspects of the entrapment doctrine.
