Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first argument ("Cryptids, by definition, are creatures whose existence is suggested but not scientifically proven...") and the second argument ("Scientific consensus requires reproducible evidence, and no cryptid has met this standard...") both refer to the lack of scientific proof for cryptids, albeit from slightly different angles (definition vs. scientific standards). Similarly, other pairs also overlap in discussing the absence of empirical evidence or scientific recognition. Thus, no pair is fully disjoint.
