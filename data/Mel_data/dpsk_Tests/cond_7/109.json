Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, the first and second arguments both refer to the definition and mathematical properties of the average, while the second and third arguments discuss the implausibility of the majority exceeding the average in typical distributions. Thus, there is semantic overlap in their justifications with respect to the claim.
