Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning. For example, one argument focuses on Hebrew as a liturgical language, another on the dominant languages of host countries, another on the diaspora's linguistic diversity, and the last on Hebrew as Israel's official language but not primary for many Jews outside Israel. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
