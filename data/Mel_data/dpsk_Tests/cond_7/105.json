Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not entirely disjoint. For example, the arguments about GDP per capita and median household income both relate to measures of average wealth, indicating some overlap in semantic content. However, there are also arguments (e.g., about poverty rate and informal economy) that introduce distinct aspects of wealth comparison, ensuring that at least one pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
