Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic theme: the necessity of replication for establishing scientific phenomena and the failure of Bem's study to meet this requirement. They all contribute to the claim by emphasizing different aspects of the same core idea, such as reliability, validity, scientific consensus, and the likelihood of chance or artifacts. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
