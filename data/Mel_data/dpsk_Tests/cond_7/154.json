Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of the claim (e.g., gender, interest in archaeology, length and success of reign, public support for the royal family) without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, there is no common semantic subset shared between any pair of justifications that contributes to the support of the claim.
