Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the same core idea: the progressive nature of the U.S. tax system ensures that higher income leads to higher take-home pay, even if a higher tax bracket is entered. They overlap in meaning by explaining how marginal tax rates work, how tax withholding adjusts, and how historical data supports this. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
