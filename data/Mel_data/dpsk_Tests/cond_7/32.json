Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. All three arguments share a common semantic theme—taxonomic classification and biological lineage—supporting the claim that toads are a type of frog. For example, the first argument mentions the order Anura, the second discusses taxonomic grouping, and the third refers to taxonomy and morphological adaptations. These justifications overlap in their support for the claim.
