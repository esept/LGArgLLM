Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, the arguments about New York City being populous, diverse, an economic hub, a tourist destination, and having expensive rents all overlap in supporting the claim that Kiwis describe New York City in those terms. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
