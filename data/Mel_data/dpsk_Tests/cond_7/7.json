Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the specific depiction of the monkey's paw in W.W. Jacobs' short story, while the second justification generalizes the concept to folklore and literature. There is no overlap in their semantic content that directly supports the claim.
