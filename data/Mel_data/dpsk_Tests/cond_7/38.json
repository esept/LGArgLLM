Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification discusses the prevalence of English in Iceland, the second focuses on the religious demographics, and the third addresses the standard of living. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim about Iceland being annexed by a great continental power.
