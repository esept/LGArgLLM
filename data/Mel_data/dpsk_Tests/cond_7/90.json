Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., geographic location, climate patterns, historical data, proximity to water bodies, meteorological studies) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning.
