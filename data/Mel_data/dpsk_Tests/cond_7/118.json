Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument addresses a different reason why universal agreement on the healthiest and most delicious dessert is impossible: (1) variation in human taste preferences, (2) lack of a single 'healthiest' dessert in nutritional science, and (3) differences in culinary traditions and ingredient availability. These justifications do not overlap in meaning.
