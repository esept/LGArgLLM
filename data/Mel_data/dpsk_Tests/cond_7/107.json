Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference official statements or documents (e.g., U.S. military statements, declassified documents) and the consistency of the debris with balloon materials. These shared semantic elements contribute to the support of the claim, indicating that the justifications are not disjoint.
