Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share a common semantic theme: they all emphasize that success is determined by real-world actions and factors, not by wishes made during dreams. For example, the first and second justifications both highlight the lack of influence of dreams on real-world outcomes, while the second and third both mention the importance of effort or actions for success. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
