Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic theme of neuroscientific evidence (e.g., fMRI, PET scans, meta-analyses, task-based neuroimaging, longitudinal studies, and clinical cases) refuting the left-brain/right-brain dominance theory. None of the pairs are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
