Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct perspective (cognitive psychology, neuroscience, art history, empirical studies on creativity, and psychological theories) on how artists draw inspiration from various sources. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that directly supports the claim.
