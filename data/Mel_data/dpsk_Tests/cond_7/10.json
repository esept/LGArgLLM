Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on the subjective and unmeasurable nature of dreams, while the second justification discusses the scientific focus on memory and brain function, not symbolic meaning. These points do not overlap in supporting the claim.
