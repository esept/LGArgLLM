Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the role of a balanced diet in preventing diseases (e.g., "disease prevention," "increased risk of chronic diseases," "higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases"). Additionally, several arguments reference the provision of essential nutrients or the support of bodily functions (e.g., "provides all essential nutrients," "supports metabolic processes"). These shared themes indicate that the justifications are not semantically disjoint.
