Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that no bodies are buried in Hoover Dam. They all refer to historical records, official documentation, construction protocols, and memorials as evidence that bodies were removed and not entombed in the dam. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
