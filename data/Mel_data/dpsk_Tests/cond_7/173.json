Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first justification focuses on the absence of a recorded composer in historical musicology, while the second justification explains the general reason why folk songs like this one often lack attributed composers (oral tradition). These points do not overlap in meaning with respect to the claim.
