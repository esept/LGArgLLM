Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that vaccines do not permanently modify DNA. They all focus on different aspects of the same underlying reasoning (e.g., mechanism of vaccines, lack of DNA integration, scientific consensus, absence of required enzymes, clinical evidence, and design of vaccines). Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
