Result: false
Justification: While many of the arguments share common themes (e.g., economic pressures, technological changes), not all pairs have overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the argument about historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not directly overlap in justification with the argument about the decline of union representation. Each argument provides a distinct reason for increased working hours without necessarily intersecting in their supporting propositions or reasoning patterns.
