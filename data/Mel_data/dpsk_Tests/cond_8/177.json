Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The common themes include France's strict but clear censorship laws, the legal framework for film classification and restriction, the overturning or non-enforcement of historical bans, and the reduction of illegal films due to public and legal challenges. These ideas are interconnected and support the claim that very few films are still illegal to show in France.
