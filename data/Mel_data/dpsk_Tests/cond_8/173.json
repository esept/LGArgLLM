Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the absence of a recorded composer in historical musicology, while the second argument explains the general phenomenon of folk songs lacking attributed composers due to oral transmission. Although both support the claim, their justifications do not intersect in terms of specific ideas or reasoning patterns.
