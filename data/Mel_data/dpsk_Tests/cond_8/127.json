Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides a different piece of evidence or reasoning that collectively undermines the validity of Amy Cuddy's power poses experiments. The common theme across all justifications is the lack of empirical support, biological plausibility, or scientific consensus for the claim that power poses change our minds. For example, replication failures, lack of mechanism, meta-analyses, and scientific consensus all converge on the idea that the original findings are not robust or reliable.
