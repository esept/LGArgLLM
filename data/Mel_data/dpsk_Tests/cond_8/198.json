Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not all share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. While some arguments overlap in discussing Princeton's age and ranking (A1 and A2), others focus on different aspects like architecture (A3) and professional schools (A4). There is no single common idea or proposition that all arguments share in their justifications.
