Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses porcupines using their tails defensively, either through observations of behavior, anatomical adaptations, or the effects on predators. The common theme is the defensive use of the tail, which directly supports the claim that porcupines attack by swinging their tails into predators.
