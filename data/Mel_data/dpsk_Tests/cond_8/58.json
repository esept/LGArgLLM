Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument compares the earnings of Americans to those in other countries, often citing specific nations (e.g., Switzerland, Norway, Luxembourg, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands) or general factors (e.g., GDP per capita, social welfare systems, income inequality gap, progressive taxation). The common theme is the relative comparison of U.S. earnings to other countries' earnings based on various economic or policy metrics.
