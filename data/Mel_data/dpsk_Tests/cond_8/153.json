Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the word 'shit' originates from Old English 'scitte' and has Proto-Germanic roots. Each justification supports this claim by referencing historical linguistic records, etymological studies, comparative linguistics, authoritative sources like the Oxford English Dictionary, and patterns of phonetic and semantic evolution. The semantic overlap is clear as all justifications converge on the same etymological origin and development of the word.
