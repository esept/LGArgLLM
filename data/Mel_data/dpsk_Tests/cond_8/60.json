Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument addresses different aspects (physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and social) of why birds cannot achieve fluency in English, but all converge on the central idea that birds lack the necessary conditions for human language fluency. For example:
- A1 (physiological) and A2 (cognitive) both imply inherent biological limitations.
- A3 (behavioral) and A4 (social) both highlight contextual inadequacies.
Thus, every pair intersects on some dimension of the claim's core reasoning.
