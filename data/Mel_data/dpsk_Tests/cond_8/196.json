Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that mirrors are passive objects without inherent properties or influences that could cause any observable effects when placed by a bed. Each justification reinforces this central theme by addressing different aspects (e.g., lack of scientific evidence, absence of interaction with physical laws, no emission of energy), ensuring semantic overlap in their support for the claim.
