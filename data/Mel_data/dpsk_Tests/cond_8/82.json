Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim. The first argument discusses Baumeister's experiments showing performance decline in self-control tasks, the second mentions meta-analyses supporting small but significant effects of ego depletion, and the third cites neuroscientific evidence aligning with Baumeister's theory. All three justifications intersect on the idea that executive function can deplete, as demonstrated by empirical evidence (experiments, meta-analyses, and neuroscience). Thus, every pair overlaps semantically in supporting the claim.
