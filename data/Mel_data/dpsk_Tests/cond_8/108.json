Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that tiger sharks rely on ram ventilation for breathing, which necessitates continuous movement. The first argument directly states this, while the second argument reinforces it by citing marine biology textbooks that classify tiger sharks as obligate ram ventilators. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
