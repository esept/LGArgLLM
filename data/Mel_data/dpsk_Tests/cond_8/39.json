Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The common theme across all justifications is the use of statistical data and surveys (e.g., Statistics Canada's 2021 census, large-scale surveys in Western countries, General Social Survey) to support the claim that the proportion of straight people in Canada is likely 94-96%. Each argument reinforces this central idea with slightly different sources or perspectives, ensuring semantic overlap.
