Result: false
Justification: The justifications for the arguments do not overlap semantically in relation to the claim. Each argument addresses a distinct aspect of Donald Sutherland's life (career, appearance, marriages/children, online presence, political views) without sharing common ideas or reasoning patterns. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications.
