Result: true
Justification: All three arguments share the common idea that universal agreement on the healthiest and most delicious dessert is impossible due to variability in human preferences, nutritional science, and culinary traditions. Each pair of arguments overlaps in addressing different aspects of this variability, reinforcing the claim's assertion that no comment can be made on a universally agreed-upon dessert.
