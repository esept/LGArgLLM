Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that premature reliance on uncertain future outcomes (counting unhatched chickens) leads to negative consequences such as overconfidence, poor planning, disappointment, or failure. Each argument reinforces this central idea from slightly different angles (e.g., overconfidence, risk of disappointment, lack of contingency plans, resource misallocation), but all converge on the same underlying principle supporting the claim.
