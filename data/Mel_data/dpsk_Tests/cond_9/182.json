Result: true  
Justification: All the justifications provided in the arguments consistently support the claim that people smoke more on average in the United States than in Russia. They reference various authoritative sources (WHO, CDC, Russian health agencies, tobacco industry reports, national health surveys) and different metrics (prevalence rates, per capita consumption, sales volumes, percentages of daily smokers, tobacco control policies, nicotine dependence studies) that all point to the same conclusion. The semantic core across all justifications is the higher smoking rates in the U.S. compared to Russia.
