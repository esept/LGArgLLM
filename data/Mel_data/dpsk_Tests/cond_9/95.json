Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core. While some arguments mention outdoor access (e.g., "Cage-free systems may provide hens with access to the outdoors"), others focus on movement within enclosed structures (e.g., "allowing them to move freely within a barn or other enclosed structure") or regulatory aspects (e.g., "Outdoor access for cage-free hens is often regulated by animal welfare standards"). There is no single shared semantic basis across all justifications.
