Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that the human body has natural detoxification systems (liver, kidneys) which are sufficient and continuous, and that juice fasts do not enhance this process or are unsupported by scientific evidence. This collective justification supports the claim that juice fasts cannot detoxify the body.
