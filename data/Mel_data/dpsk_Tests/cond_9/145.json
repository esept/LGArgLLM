Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that "Gestapo's Last Orgy was banned by British censors due to its explicit, violent, or exploitative content violating UK laws or censorship standards." Each argument provides a slightly different reason (e.g., Obscene Publications Act, BBFC refusal, glorification of Nazi atrocities, historical revisionism, or classification as a 'video nasty'), but all converge on the same conclusion that the film was banned by British authorities for its content.
