Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by focusing on higher obesity rates in Mexico compared to Ireland, backed by data from reputable sources (WHO, national health surveys, dietary studies, and epidemiological data). The justifications consistently highlight Mexico's greater obesity prevalence and related issues, aligning with the claim's assertion.
