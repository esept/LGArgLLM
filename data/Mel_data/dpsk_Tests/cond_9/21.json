Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a single semantic core. While they all relate to the claim about chicken and pork consumption in the United States, they cover distinct factors such as cultural preferences, affordability, health perceptions, industry efficiency, religious restrictions, and marketing trends. There is no common intersection in meaning across all justifications that serves as a unified support for the claim.
