Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic core that Bargh's study lacks the necessary scientific rigor (consistent reproducibility and methodological robustness) to establish a psychological law. The first argument emphasizes the lack of consistent evidence, while the second highlights specific methodological flaws, but both converge on the idea that the study fails to meet the standards required for a psychological law.
