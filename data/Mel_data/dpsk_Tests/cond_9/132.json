Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. While all arguments support the claim that people drink less coffee in the US than in Mexico, they do so based on different reasons (per capita consumption, cultural traditions, market share of alternative beverages, and preference for tea). There is no single overlapping semantic basis across all justifications.
