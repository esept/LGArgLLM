Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that brain imaging technology (fMRI, PET scans, etc.) does not support the idea of left-brain or right-brain dominance. Each justification emphasizes the lack of empirical evidence for hemispheric dominance in cognitive functions, the coordination of both hemispheres in tasks, and the oversimplification of the left/right-brain dichotomy. This collective support refutes the claim's distinction between left-brained and right-brained thinkers.
