Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a single, common semantic core. While they all support the claim that per capita income is higher in the US than in Japan, they do so through different and distinct reasons (e.g., economic size and diversification, aging population, currency strength, productivity and innovation, deflationary pressures). There is no overlapping semantic intersection across all justifications.
