Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments do not share a common semantic core. Each justification supports a different aspect of the claim (graduation from Michigan, running tech companies, playing chess, rarity of the name Elon, and public profiles confirming these facts). There is no single overlapping semantic basis that all justifications collectively support.
