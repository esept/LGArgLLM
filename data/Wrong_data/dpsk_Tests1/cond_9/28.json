Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not fully overlap in their semantic support for the claim. While both mention the euro as the official currency, the first justification includes Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU and does not use the euro as its official currency. The second justification correctly focuses on France and Germany but omits Switzerland, leading to a lack of common semantic core across all justifications.
