Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that supports the claim by referencing statistical data and surveys (e.g., Statistics Canada's 2021 census, large-scale surveys in Western countries, General Social Survey) to establish that the proportion of straight people in Canada is likely 94-96%. The justifications consistently rely on empirical evidence and demographic patterns to justify the claim.
