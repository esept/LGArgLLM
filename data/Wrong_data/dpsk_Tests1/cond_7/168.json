Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim that vaccines do not permanently modify DNA. They all focus on different aspects of how vaccines interact with the body (immune system stimulation, lack of DNA integration, scientific consensus, absence of gene-editing technology, and degradation of vaccine components), but all contribute to the same overarching point. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
