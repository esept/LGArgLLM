Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the safety of nuclear power (e.g., lower fatality rate, advanced safety features, minimal air pollution, low greenhouse gas emissions), and none of these reasons overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
