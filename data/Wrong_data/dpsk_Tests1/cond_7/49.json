Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the general requirement for scientific laws (consistent and reproducible evidence), while the second argument addresses specific methodological limitations in Bargh's study (small sample size, lack of preregistration). These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to supporting the claim.
