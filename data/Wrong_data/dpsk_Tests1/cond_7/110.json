Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (historical data, gig economy, technological advancements, economic pressures, decline of labor unions) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments is disjoint.
