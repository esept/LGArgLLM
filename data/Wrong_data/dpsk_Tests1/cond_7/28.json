Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications refer to the adoption or use of the euro in Germany and France, which are part of the claim. The first justification mentions the euro as the official currency in these countries due to their EU membership, while the second provides specific details about when they adopted the euro. Both contribute to supporting the claim by reinforcing the idea that these countries use the euro.
