Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is the lack of definitive evidence or consensus on who designed the first American flag. Each argument provides different aspects or reasons (e.g., historical records, multiple claimants, lack of documentation, ongoing debates, absence of signed proposals) but all converge on the same central idea supporting the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
