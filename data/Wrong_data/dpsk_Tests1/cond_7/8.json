Result: true
Justification: The justifications for the arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on per capita consumption data, the second on total consumption due to population size, the third on the craft beer movement, and the fourth on regulatory differences. None of these justifications share a common semantic subset that directly supports the claim in the same way.
