Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on debunking disappearances with documented explanations, the second on scientific investigations confirming no unusual phenomena, and the third on the sensationalist media's role in popularizing the legend. Each justification addresses a distinct aspect of why the narrative is fabricated without overlapping in meaning.
