```
Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (e.g., advancements in manufacturing technology, global supply chains, inflation-adjusted data, and proliferation of budget-friendly brands) that does not overlap in meaning with the others. Thus, at least one pair is disjoint.
