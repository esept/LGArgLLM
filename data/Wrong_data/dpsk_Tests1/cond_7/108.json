Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the same core idea (tiger sharks' need for constant swimming due to obligate ram ventilation), but they approach it from slightly different angles (biological mechanism, comparison with other species, observational evidence, anatomical adaptation). Since none of the justifications are entirely disjoint—they all contribute to supporting the claim by elaborating on the same underlying concept—the result is false. However, since the task asks whether at least one pair is disjoint, and none are, the correct answer is false. But given the phrasing of the task ("If at least one pair is disjoint, return True"), and since no pairs are disjoint here, we return false.
