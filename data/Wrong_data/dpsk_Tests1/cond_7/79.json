Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in meaning as they all provide evidence supporting the claim that Mexico has a higher obesity rate than Ireland. For example, arguments about WHO data, national health surveys, public health policies, dietary studies, and epidemiological data all contribute to the same overarching point. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
