Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap semantically as they all compare the earnings of Americans to those in other countries, often citing specific nations (e.g., Switzerland, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark) and factors like GDP per capita, social welfare systems, and taxation policies. Since none of the pairs are completely disjoint in their semantic contribution to the claim, the result is false.
