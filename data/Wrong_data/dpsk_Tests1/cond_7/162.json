Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason supporting the claim (e.g., rugby being a niche sport, other sports being more popular, surveys indicating low popularity, and physical demands deterring participation). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
