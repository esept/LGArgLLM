Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments reference outperforming the S&P 500's average returns (e.g., "significantly outperforms the average market return" and "exceeding this by 5% annually for ten years"). Additionally, several arguments highlight long-term consistency and exceptional performance as indicators of a great investor (e.g., "Long-term consistency in high returns" and "Outperforming benchmarks...over a ten-year period"). Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
