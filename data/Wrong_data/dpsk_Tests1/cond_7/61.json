Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint as they each describe different mechanisms (thermal conductivity, evaporation, freezing, and thermoregulation) by which wet hair in cold weather can make you feel chilly. There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications with respect to supporting the claim.
