Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications relate to the process of water boiling due to heat transfer, with one focusing on the boiling point temperature and the other on the mechanism of heat transfer from the stove. They share a common semantic subset related to the conditions under which water boils.
