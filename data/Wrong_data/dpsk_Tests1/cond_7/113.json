Result: false
Justification: All justifications provided are related to the context and timing of Nixon's statement "I am not a crook" in connection to the Watergate scandal. They overlap semantically as they all support the claim by reinforcing that Nixon's denial was directly linked to the Watergate scandal. Therefore, no pair of justifications is disjoint.
