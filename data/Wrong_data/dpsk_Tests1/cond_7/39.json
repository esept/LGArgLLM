Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. For example, A1 and A2 both reference statistical data (Statistics Canada's census and large-scale surveys in Western countries) to support the claim about the proportion of straight people in Canada. Similarly, A3 and A4 both discuss the reliability of self-reported data in surveys regarding sexual orientation. Since multiple pairs share overlapping semantic content in their justifications, they are not disjoint.
