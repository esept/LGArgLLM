Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument cites epidemiological studies showing a correlation between moderate wine consumption and reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, while the second argument focuses on the presence of antioxidants like resveratrol in red wine and their potential health benefits. These are distinct lines of reasoning without a common idea or proposition.
