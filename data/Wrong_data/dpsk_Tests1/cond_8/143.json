Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either references legal ethics (e.g., ABA Model Rules, integrity of the judicial system), legal consequences (e.g., perjury laws, disbarment), or the fundamental principle of truth-seeking in the U.S. legal system. These themes are interconnected and support the claim that lawyers cannot give false evidence to exonerate their clients.
