Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument provides a different metric (GDP per capita, median household income, poverty rate, HDI, cost of living and wages) that collectively supports the idea that people in Japan are richer than people in Mexico. These metrics all relate to economic conditions and wealth indicators, ensuring semantic overlap between any pair of arguments.
