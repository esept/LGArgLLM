Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument supports the idea that providing video recordings does not negatively impact class attendance, either by citing studies, highlighting interactive elements, noting student preferences, or emphasizing recordings as supplementary tools. The common theme across all justifications is the stability or lack of significant change in attendance when recordings are provided.
