Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses the shared evolutionary lineage (order Anura), the second mentions the lack of defining characteristics separating toads from frogs, and the third clarifies that 'toad' is a common name for certain frog species. All three justifications reinforce the idea that toads are biologically classified within the broader category of frogs, either through taxonomy, evolutionary lineage, or morphological similarities.
