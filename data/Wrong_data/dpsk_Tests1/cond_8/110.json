Result: false
Justification: While all arguments support the claim that working hours of Americans have increased over time, their justifications do not all share overlapping semantic content. For example, the argument about historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not overlap semantically with the argument about technological advancements blurring work-life boundaries. Each argument presents a distinct reason for the increase in working hours without necessarily sharing common ideas or reasoning patterns.
