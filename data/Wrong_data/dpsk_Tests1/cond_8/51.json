Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that there is no definitive evidence or consensus on who designed the first American flag. Each argument either mentions the lack of historical records, conflicting accounts, or the absence of conclusive evidence, which directly supports the claim. Therefore, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justifications related to the claim.
