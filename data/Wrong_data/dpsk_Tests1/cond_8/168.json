Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that vaccines do not interact with or modify DNA, either by explaining the mechanism of action (stimulating the immune system, not altering genetic material), stating the absence of DNA-modifying technology in vaccines, or emphasizing the degradation of vaccine components without long-term persistence. Thus, every pair of arguments overlaps in supporting this core idea.
