Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that Bargh's study lacks the necessary scientific rigor (consistent reproducibility and methodological robustness) to establish a psychological law. The first argument emphasizes the lack of consistent and reproducible evidence, while the second highlights specific methodological limitations like small sample size and lack of preregistration. Both justifications converge on the point that Bargh's study fails to meet the standards required for a psychological law.
