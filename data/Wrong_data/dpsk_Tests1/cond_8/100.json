Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share at least one common idea or reasoning pattern related to the claim. For example, the first argument (official labor statistics) and the last argument (historical data) both reference statistical trends in working hours. The second (gig economy) and fourth (economic pressures) arguments both discuss economic factors leading to longer working hours. The third argument (technological advancements) intersects with others by addressing modern work conditions that contribute to increased working time. Thus, all justifications overlap semantically in supporting the claim.
