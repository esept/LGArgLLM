Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses debunked disappearances due to documented explanations, the second mentions scientific investigations confirming no unusual phenomena, and the third highlights sensationalist media as the source of the legend. While they focus on different aspects (documented explanations, scientific confirmation, media influence), all three ultimately support the idea that the Bermuda Triangle narrative is fabricated by providing evidence against its validity or explaining its origins.
