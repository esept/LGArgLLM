Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the negative consequences of prematurely assuming or relying on uncertain future outcomes, such as overconfidence, poor planning, disappointment, financial loss, lack of contingency plans, resource misallocation, and distraction from present actions. These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments intersects in their reasoning about why counting chickens before they hatch leads to failure.
