Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument either cites scientific studies, the composition of pangolin scales, the lack of recognition by medical organizations, the absence of empirical validation, or the lack of bioactive compounds as reasons why pangolin scales are not effective medicine. These justifications consistently reinforce the claim through shared reasoning patterns (e.g., lack of evidence, composition, or institutional non-recognition).
