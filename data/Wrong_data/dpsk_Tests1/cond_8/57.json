Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument revolves around the idea that alternative medicine lacks rigorous empirical evidence, scientific consensus, or universal endorsement by mainstream institutions or regulatory agencies. For example, the lack of empirical evidence is mentioned in multiple arguments, as is the absence of universal endorsement by institutions like the WHO, NIH, or FDA. The inconsistent results from peer-reviewed studies and contradictions with established scientific principles also overlap thematically. Thus, every pair of arguments shares at least one common idea supporting the claim.
