Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument emphasizes the lack of scientific evidence, biological implausibility, or the necessity of medical interventions beyond touch to cure diseases. For example, arguments about medical science's lack of evidence (A1) and peer-reviewed studies (A4) overlap in their focus on empirical support, while arguments about biological mechanisms (A3) and targeted treatments (A5) both highlight the physiological requirements for curing diseases.
