Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the necessity of constant swimming for tiger sharks due to their reliance on obligate ram ventilation, inability to pump water over their gills while stationary, observed continuous swimming behavior, or anatomical adaptations for ram ventilation. These ideas are interconnected and support the claim that tiger sharks can't stop swimming.
