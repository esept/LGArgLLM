Result: true  
Justification: Both justifications share a common semantic core related to the process of water reaching its boiling point when heated on a stove. The first justification explains the condition (reaching 100Â°C) for boiling, while the second explains the mechanism (applying heat) that leads to that condition. Together, they support the claim by describing the necessary steps for water to boil when watched on a stove.
