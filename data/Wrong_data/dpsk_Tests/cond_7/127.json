Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (failed replications, lack of biological mechanism, meta-analyses, scientific consensus) that independently supports the claim without overlapping in meaning. Thus, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
