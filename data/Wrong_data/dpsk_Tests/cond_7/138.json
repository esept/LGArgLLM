Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments relate to different aspects of the claim (size, diversity, economic hub, tourism, and expensive rents), but they all contribute to supporting the claim without overlapping in semantic content. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
