Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications relate to the process of water reaching its boiling point when heated, which directly supports the claim. The first argument states the condition for boiling (reaching 100Â°C), and the second argument explains how applying heat leads to reaching that condition. Thus, they share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
