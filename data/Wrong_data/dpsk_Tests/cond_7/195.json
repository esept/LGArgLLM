Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason for the increase in lung cancer rates (smoking prevalence, improved diagnostics, environmental factors, demographic aging), and none of these reasons overlap in meaning or share a common semantic subset that supports the claim.
