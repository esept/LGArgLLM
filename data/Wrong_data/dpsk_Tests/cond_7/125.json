Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites large-scale longitudinal studies focusing on IQ differences, while the second argument relies on twin studies comparing siblings. Although both support the claim, they do so through different types of evidence (longitudinal vs. twin studies) and different aspects of the claim (IQ differences vs. cognitive outcomes). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications.
