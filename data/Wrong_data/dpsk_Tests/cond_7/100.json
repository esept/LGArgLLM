Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, the first argument cites official labor statistics showing increased working hours, while the second argument discusses technological advancements blurring work-personal time boundaries. These justifications address different aspects (statistical evidence vs. behavioral impact) and do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim. Similarly, the other arguments (gig economy, economic pressures) provide distinct reasons without overlapping semantic content.
