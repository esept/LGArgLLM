Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains or overlaps with the semantic content of at least one S-type argument. For example, the S-type argument about small effect sizes and lack of statistical robustness supports the P-type argument about replication failures. Similarly, the S-type argument about placebo effects aligns with the P-type argument about the lack of a biological mechanism. Thus, every minimal semantic basis of the claim is covered by at least one P-type argument.
