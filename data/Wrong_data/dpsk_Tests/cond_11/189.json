Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains elements that align with the minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments. For instance, the S-type argument about financial markets having periods of high returns is a subset of the P-type argument about survivorship bias and the role of chance. Similarly, the S-type argument about historical data on sustained performance aligns with the P-type arguments on statistical analysis and academic research. Thus, for every minimal semantic basis of the claim, there exists at least one P-type argument whose justification contains that basis.
