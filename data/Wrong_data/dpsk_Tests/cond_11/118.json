Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification encompasses the semantic content of the S-type arguments. For instance, the first P-type argument about human taste preferences varying widely includes the S-type argument about empirical surveys showing divergence in preferences. Similarly, the second P-type argument about nutritional science not identifying a single healthiest dessert includes the S-type argument about the context-dependence of 'healthiest'. The third P-type argument about culinary traditions differing globally also supports the claim by addressing the impossibility of unanimous agreement, which aligns with the S-type arguments. Thus, all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments.
