Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains semantic subsets that align with the S-type arguments, which provide minimal semantic support for the claim. For example, the first P-type argument's reliance on oral tradition is supported by S-type arguments about the lack of contemporary evidence and the late popularization of the story. The second P-type argument's focus on collaborative effort is supported by S-type arguments about Francis Hopkinson's involvement and the absence of Ross's designs. Thus, all minimal semantic bases of the claim are covered by the P-type arguments.
