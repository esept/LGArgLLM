Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification encompasses the semantic content of at least one S-type argument. For instance, the first P argument about large-scale studies aligns with the S argument about meta-analyses showing small benefits, and the second P argument about twin studies aligns with the S argument about neuroscientific research lacking mechanisms. Thus, all minimal semantic bases (S-type arguments) are covered by the P-type arguments' justifications.
