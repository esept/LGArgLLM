Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that tiger sharks cannot stop swimming due to their reliance on ram ventilation and classification as obligate ram ventilators. However, the S-type arguments present evidence that contradicts this claim, showing that tiger sharks can stop swimming temporarily due to their spiracles and observed resting behaviors. Since the S-type arguments provide minimal semantic support sets that contradict the claim, C11 is not satisfied.
