Result: true  
Justification: Each P-type argument's justification contains semantic subsets that align with the support arguments (S-type). For example, the P-type argument about no higher incidence of ship disappearances is supported by the S-type argument attributing disappearances to natural causes. Similarly, the P-type argument about debunked disappearances is supported by the S-type argument about sensationalized media reports. Thus, for every minimal semantic basis of the claim, there exists a P-type argument whose justification contains that basis.
