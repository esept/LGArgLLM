Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that heating water on a stove leads to an increase in temperature, which is necessary for boiling. The first argument states the condition for boiling (reaching 100Â°C), and the second explains how this condition is met (by applying heat). Thus, their justifications overlap in supporting the claim.
