Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that Nixon's statement "I am not a crook" was made in the context of the Watergate scandal. Each argument either directly states this connection or provides supporting evidence (e.g., historical records, public interpretation, Nixon's resignation) that reinforces the link between the statement and the scandal. Therefore, every pair of arguments overlaps in their justification regarding this central idea.
