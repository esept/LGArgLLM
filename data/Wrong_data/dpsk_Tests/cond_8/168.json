Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that vaccines do not modify DNA, either by explaining the mechanism (e.g., mRNA not entering the nucleus, lack of enzymes for DNA modification) or by referencing scientific consensus and evidence (e.g., clinical trials, long-term studies). The justifications consistently support the claim without contradiction or divergence in reasoning.
