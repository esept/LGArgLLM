Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. The arguments all revolve around the mathematical properties of the average (mean) and how it interacts with the distribution of numbers in a set. Specifically, they discuss the central tendency of the mean, the implausibility of the majority exceeding the average without extreme conditions, and the role of symmetry or outliers in the distribution. These ideas are interconnected and support the claim from slightly different but overlapping perspectives.
