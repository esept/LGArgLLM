Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the difficulty of attributing consistent high returns to skill, citing factors like survivorship bias, statistical rarity, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and academic research on underperformance. These ideas collectively support the claim that skill cannot be definitively concluded due to these influences.
