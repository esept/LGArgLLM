Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that dissociative identity disorder and multiple personality disorder are related terms, either through historical usage or interchangeable use in literature. The first argument mentions the historical connection via the DSM, while the second highlights the interchangeable use in clinical and academic contexts. Both justifications support the claim by reinforcing the relationship between the two terms.
