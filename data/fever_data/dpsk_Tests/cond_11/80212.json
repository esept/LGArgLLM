Result: false  
Justification: The provided arguments and justifications do not align with the claim about Westworld's first season having one episode. The P-type arguments discuss Jenny McCarthy's modeling for Playboy, which is irrelevant to the claim about Westworld. The S-type arguments include one relevant point about TV series seasons typically having multiple episodes, but there is no P-type argument whose justification contains this semantic basis. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
