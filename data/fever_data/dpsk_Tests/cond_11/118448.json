Result: false  
Justification: The claim is about Richard Dawson's date of birth, and the P-type arguments provided do not have justifications that are semantic subsets of any S-type arguments. The S-type arguments are unrelated to the claim, discussing Pink's nationality and other irrelevant topics. Therefore, there is no minimal semantic basis from the S-type arguments that is contained within the P-type arguments' justifications.
