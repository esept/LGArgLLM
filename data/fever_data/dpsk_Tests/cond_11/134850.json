Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments provided relate to the claim "Ice-T refused to ever make hip-hop music." The justifications of the P-type arguments discuss unrelated topics such as film production, actors' birthdates, and geographical data, which do not form any semantic basis for the given claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
