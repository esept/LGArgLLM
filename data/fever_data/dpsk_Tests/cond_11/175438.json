Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments provided have justifications that relate to the claim about "Death Note being a Japanese television drama series that first aired in 2015." The P-type arguments discuss entirely unrelated topics such as "Mutiny on the Bounty," Richard Dawson's birthdate, the Gettysburg Address, and others, none of which overlap semantically with the claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
