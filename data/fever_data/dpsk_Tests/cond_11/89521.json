Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provided do not directly support the claim that "Mom (TV series) has received one nomination." The first three P-type arguments discuss Zoe Saldana's birth date and astrological sign, which are irrelevant to the claim. The fourth P-type argument mentions a nomination for Mom (TV series), but there is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of this P-type argument's justification. Additionally, the S-type arguments either dispute the relevance of astrological signs or discuss other aspects of the show's recognition, none of which form a minimal semantic basis for the claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
