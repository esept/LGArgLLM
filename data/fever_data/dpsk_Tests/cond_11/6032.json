Result: false  
Justification: The claim "Aruba is the only ABC Island" is contradicted by the support arguments (S-type), which explicitly state that the term 'ABC Islands' includes Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura√ßao, and that Aruba shares cultural and linguistic similarities with the other two islands. The P-type arguments do not provide a semantic subset that supports the claim; instead, they highlight differences (geographical and political) that do not justify Aruba being the only ABC Island. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
