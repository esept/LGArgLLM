Result: false  
Justification: The provided arguments (P-type and S-type) do not form a coherent semantic basis for the claim "Daredevil is based on the character of the same name." The P-type arguments include irrelevant information (e.g., about Mutiny on the Bounty, Richard Dawson, Gettysburg Address) and only one weakly related argument about the TV show 'Daredevil' following the comic book character. None of the S-type arguments provide meaningful support for this claim either, as they discuss unrelated topics (e.g., Pink's nationality, Mount Hood, Burbank's industry). Thus, there is no minimal semantic basis for the claim supported by the given arguments.
