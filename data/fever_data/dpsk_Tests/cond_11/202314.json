Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments provided directly support the claim that "The New Jersey Turnpike has zero shoulders" with justifications that are semantic subsets of any S-type arguments. The P-type arguments related to the New Jersey Turnpike discuss specific scenarios (e.g., construction zones, older sections) but do not fully encompass or align with the minimal semantic basis required to support the claim universally. Additionally, there are no S-type arguments in the given list that provide fragments of minimal semantic support for this specific claim. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
