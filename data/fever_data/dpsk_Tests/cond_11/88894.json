Result: true  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide sufficient justification for the claim that Zoe Saldana is a Leo, as they confirm her birth date falls within the Leo range and there is no dispute about her birth date. The S-type arguments do not undermine the P-type arguments but rather address potential minor issues (e.g., typographical errors, lack of scientific validation, or incomplete astrological data), which do not negate the core justification provided by the P-type arguments. Therefore, the minimal semantic basis of the claim is fully supported by the P-type arguments.
