Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provided are unrelated to the claim about Mount Hood being the lowest point in its state. Instead, they discuss Richard Dawson's birthdate, which is irrelevant. The S-type arguments correctly address the claim but are not supported by any P-type arguments whose justifications contain or relate to them semantically. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
