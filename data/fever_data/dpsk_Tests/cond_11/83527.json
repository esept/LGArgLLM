Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments focus on reasons why the Blue Dog Coalition might be mistakenly associated with Republicans (e.g., alignment with conservative principles or members switching parties). However, none of their justifications semantically contain the minimal support provided by the S-type arguments, which directly refute the claim by stating the Coalition was formed by Democrats. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
