Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications contain a semantic subset from the S-type arguments that directly supports the claim about dissociative identity disorder being known as multiple personality disorder. The only relevant P-type argument (with confidence 0.9) does not have a corresponding S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of its justification. The S-type arguments provided do not address the historical naming conventions of dissociative identity disorder.
