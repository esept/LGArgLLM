Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications about the Enosis movement and the 1974 coup as attempts to incorporate Cyprus into Greece. However, none of the S-type arguments' justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type justifications. Instead, the S-type arguments contradict or undermine the claim by pointing to Cyprus's independence, international treaties prohibiting union, and opposition to Enosis. Thus, C11 is not satisfied because there are no support arguments whose justifications are subsets of the P-type justifications and contribute to supporting the claim.
