Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications based on geographical proximity, linguistic ties, historical control, and cultural movements, but none of these justifications fully encompass the minimal semantic support sets provided by the S-type arguments (legal status, international recognition, current governance). Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
