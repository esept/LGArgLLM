Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that commodore might be ranked above rear admiral in certain historical or non-NATO contexts, but none of the S-type arguments (which provide fragments of minimal semantic support for the claim) align with or support these justifications. Instead, the S-type arguments contradict the claim by stating that in modern or specific contexts (e.g., U.S. Navy, British Royal Navy), commodore is either below rear admiral or not a formal rank above it. Thus, there is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of the P-type arguments' justifications that supports the claim.
