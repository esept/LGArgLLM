Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim by highlighting characteristics of a speech (e.g., delivered orally, intended for an audience, referred to as a speech). However, the S-type arguments provide justifications that challenge the claim by suggesting the Gettysburg Address might not be a speech (e.g., it is more like a written address or proclamation). There is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of any P-type argument's justification and supports the claim. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
