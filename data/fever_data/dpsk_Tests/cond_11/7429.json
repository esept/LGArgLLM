Result: false  
Justification: The P-type arguments provide justifications that support the claim, but none of the S-type arguments' justifications are semantic subsets of the P-type arguments' justifications. Additionally, the S-type arguments contradict the claim rather than supporting it, which means C11 is not satisfied. There is no minimal semantic basis from the S-type arguments that is contained within any P-type argument's justification.
