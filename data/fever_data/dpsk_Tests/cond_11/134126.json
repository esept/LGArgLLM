Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications relate to the claim "Jason Bourne removed Riz Ahmed from the movie's cast." The justifications provided are about unrelated topics such as film production, actor birth records, and geographical data, which do not support or oppose the given claim. Additionally, there is no S-type argument whose justification is a semantic subset of any P-type argument's justification in this context. The only relevant S-type argument (id: 0.09999999999999998) states that Jason Bourne is a fictional character and cannot make real-world decisions, but this does not align with any P-type argument's justification. Therefore, C11 is not satisfied.
