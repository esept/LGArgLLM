Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications semantically support the claim that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was a founding participant of the UN, nor do they contain any minimal semantic basis provided by the S-type arguments. The only relevant P-type argument (with confidence 0.88) discusses the Ukrainian SSR's distinct role in the UN General Assembly but does not directly address its founding participation, and none of the S-type arguments provide a semantic subset that supports this claim.
