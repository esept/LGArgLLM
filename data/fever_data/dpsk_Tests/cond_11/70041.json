Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments provide justifications that cover the minimal semantic bases required to support the claim that "2 Hearts is a musical composition by Minogue." Specifically, the P-type arguments collectively address Kylie Minogue's authorship through her reputation, official release, lack of competing claims, and public performances. The S-type arguments introduce doubts but do not undermine the completeness of the P-type justifications in covering the minimal semantic bases for the claim.
