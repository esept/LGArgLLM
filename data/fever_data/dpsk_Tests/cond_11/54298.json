Result: false  
Justification: The S-type arguments provide counterexamples and exceptions to the claim, indicating that not all states employing the electric chair allow prisoners to choose lethal injection. These S-type arguments do not support the claim but rather contradict it by showing that the claim is not universally true. Therefore, there is no minimal semantic basis of the claim that is fully supported by the P-type arguments in light of the S-type arguments.
