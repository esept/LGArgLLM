Result: false  
Justification: None of the P-type arguments' justifications contain the minimal semantic support provided by the S-type arguments. The S-type arguments provide concrete evidence (e.g., lack of public records, radio play, absence of media coverage) that directly contradicts the claim, while the P-type arguments speculate about possible misinterpretations or hypothetical scenarios without addressing the factual basis provided by the S-type arguments. Thus, C11 is not satisfied.
