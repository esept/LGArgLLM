Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not relate to the claim about Ice-T refusing to make hip-hop music. Instead, they discuss unrelated topics such as film production, actors' backgrounds, Richard Dawson's birth records, the Gettysburg Address, and the TV show 'Daredevil'. There is no common semantic core that supports the claim.
