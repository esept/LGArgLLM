Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core that supports the claim about Daredevil being based on the character of the same name. The arguments are disjointed and cover unrelated topics such as Mutiny on the Bounty, Richard Dawson's birth records, and the Gettysburg Address, with only one argument marginally related to Daredevil.
