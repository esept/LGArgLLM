Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim about the TV series "Mom" receiving a nomination. The first three justifications discuss Zoe Saldana's birth date and astrological sign, which are unrelated to the claim. Only the fourth justification directly addresses the claim about the nomination, but it stands alone without overlap with the others.
