Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not relate to the claim about Westworld's first season having one episode. Instead, they discuss Jenny McCarthy's modeling for Playboy, which is completely unrelated to the claim. Therefore, there is no common semantic intersection that supports the claim.
