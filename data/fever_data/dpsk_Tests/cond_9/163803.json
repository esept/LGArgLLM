Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim about the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's role in the UN. Most of the arguments are unrelated to the claim, discussing topics like film production, actors' birthdates, and other historical events. Only one argument (the last one) directly addresses the claim, but it is not supported by overlapping justifications from other arguments.
