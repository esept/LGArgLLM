Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first two arguments about "Mutiny on the Bounty" and its cast are irrelevant to Richard Dawson's date of birth. The last three arguments do support the claim but are not semantically overlapping with the first two, hence no common intersection exists across all justifications.
