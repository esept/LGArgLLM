Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on the operational authority of a commodore in historical contexts, while the second justification discusses differing ranking systems in non-NATO or historical navies. These are distinct reasons and do not intersect semantically.
