Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core related to the claim about Jason Bourne removing Riz Ahmed from the movie's cast. The arguments and their justifications are about unrelated topics such as Mutiny on the Bounty, Richard Dawson's birth records, the Gettysburg Address, and the TV show Daredevil. There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
