Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on Aruba's geographical distinctiveness (being outside the hurricane belt), while the second argument highlights its political status (constituent country vs. special municipalities). These are distinct reasons supporting the claim and do not intersect in meaning.
