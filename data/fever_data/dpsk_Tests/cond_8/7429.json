Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern. The first argument cites direct evidence from interviews and memoirs, the second relies on the absence of counter-evidence, the third points to media archives, and the fourth uses the lack of public denial. These are distinct lines of reasoning without semantic overlap.
