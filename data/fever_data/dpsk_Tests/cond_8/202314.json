Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses the lack of shoulders in urban or congested areas, while the second focuses on temporary elimination of shoulders due to construction or maintenance. These are distinct reasons for the absence of shoulders and do not intersect in meaning.
