Result: false
Justification: The arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim about Daredevil. Most of the arguments are unrelated to the claim, discussing topics like Mutiny on the Bounty, Richard Dawson's birth records, and the Gettysburg Address. Only one argument directly relates to the claim about Daredevil, and it does not overlap with any other arguments in terms of justification.
