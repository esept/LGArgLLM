Result: false
Justification: The first three arguments discuss Zoe Saldana's birth date and astrological sign, which are unrelated to the claim about the TV series "Mom" receiving a nomination. The fourth argument directly addresses the claim but does not share any semantic overlap with the justifications of the first three arguments. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
