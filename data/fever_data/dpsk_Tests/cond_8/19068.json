Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share any common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern in relation to the claim. The first argument relies on Bruce Willis's activity in Hollywood during the mid-1990s, while the second argument is based on the release year of the film's soundtrack. These are distinct pieces of evidence with no semantic overlap.
