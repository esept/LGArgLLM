Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications. The first argument focuses on the historical use of the title "commodore" for senior captains commanding multiple ships, implying higher operational authority. The second argument discusses differing ranking systems in non-NATO or historical contexts. While both relate to the claim, their justifications do not intersect in terms of shared ideas, propositions, or reasoning patterns.
