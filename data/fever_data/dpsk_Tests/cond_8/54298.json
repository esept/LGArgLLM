Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications related to the claim. Each argument discusses the provision of lethal injection as an alternative to the electric chair, often citing reasons such as humaneness, legal requirements, avoidance of suffering, or explicit protocols. These common themes ensure that every pair of arguments intersects in their support for the claim.
