Result: false
Justification: The justifications provided do not share any common ideas, propositions, or reasoning patterns related to the claim about the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic being a founding participant of the UN. Most of the arguments are unrelated to the claim, discussing topics like film production, actor associations, Richard Dawson's birthdate, the Gettysburg Address, and a TV show. Only one argument (the last one) directly addresses the claim, but it does not overlap semantically with any other argument.
