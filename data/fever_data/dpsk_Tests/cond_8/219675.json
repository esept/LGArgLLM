Result: false
Justification: While the arguments share a general theme of Corsica's ties to Italy (geographical, linguistic, historical, and cultural), not all pairs of arguments have overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the geographical proximity argument (A1) does not semantically overlap with the nationalist movements argument (A4) in terms of specific reasoning or propositions. Similarly, the linguistic argument (A2) and the nationalist movements argument (A4) do not share a direct common idea beyond the broad theme of cultural ties. Thus, not all pairs satisfy the condition of semantic overlap in their justifications.
