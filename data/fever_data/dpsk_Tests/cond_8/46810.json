Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument discusses temporary restrictions in specific venues or events due to local policies, while the second argument mentions lobbying by cultural or religious groups for a ban due to perceived inappropriate themes. These justifications address different scenarios and do not intersect in meaning.
