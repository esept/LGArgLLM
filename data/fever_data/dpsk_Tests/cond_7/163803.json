Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Most arguments (e.g., about Mutiny on the Bounty, Richard Dawson's birthdate, the Gettysburg Address, and Daredevil) are entirely unrelated to the claim about the Ukrainian SSR's role in the UN. Only one argument (A8) directly addresses the claim, while the others do not share any semantic overlap with it or each other in supporting the claim.
