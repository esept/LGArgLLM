Result: true
Justification: The first three arguments discuss Zoe Saldana's birth date and astrological sign, which are unrelated to the claim about the TV series "Mom" receiving a nomination. The fourth argument directly addresses the claim. Therefore, there is at least one pair of arguments (e.g., any of the first three with the fourth) whose justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
