Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason why the claim is incorrect (e.g., official reports, aircraft capacity, media coverage, potential typographical error, aviation safety records). There is no overlap in the semantic content of their justifications that contributes to supporting the claim.
