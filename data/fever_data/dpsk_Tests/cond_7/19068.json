Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on Bruce Willis's activity in Hollywood during the mid-1990s, while the second argument discusses the release year of the film's soundtrack. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
