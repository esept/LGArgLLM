Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. For example, arguments about Richard Dawson's birthdate, the Ukrainian SSR's UN seat, and the New Jersey Turnpike's shoulders do not share any common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim about Commodore's rank above a rear admiral.
