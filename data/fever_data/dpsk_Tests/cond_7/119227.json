Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument's justification is about official birth records confirming a date, while the second argument's justification is about the person mentioning the date in interviews. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim about Mount Hood being the lowest point in its state.
