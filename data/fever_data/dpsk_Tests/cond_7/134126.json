Result: true
Justification: The justifications provided for the arguments are all unrelated to the claim about Jason Bourne removing Riz Ahmed from the movie's cast. Each justification discusses different topics such as film production, actor backgrounds, birth records, and historical speeches, none of which overlap semantically with the claim or each other in a way that supports the claim. Therefore, all pairs of justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
