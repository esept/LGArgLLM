Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share overlapping semantic content related to the claim, such as the humane aspect, legal requirements, and prisoner choice. However, each argument introduces a distinct perspective (e.g., legal precedents, botched executions, explicit protocols), making them not entirely disjoint. Thus, there is at least one pair of arguments whose justifications are not semantically disjoint.
