Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument relies on direct evidence from interviews and memoirs, the second on media archives and Playboy's publications, and the third on the absence of public denial. Each justification provides a distinct type of evidence supporting the claim without overlapping in meaning.
