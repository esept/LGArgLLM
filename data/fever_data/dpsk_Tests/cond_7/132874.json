Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The claim is about the TV show 'Daredevil' being based on the comic book character, but most of the arguments provided are unrelated (e.g., about Mutiny on the Bounty, Richard Dawson's birth records, and the Gettysburg Address). Only one argument directly relates to the claim, but it does not overlap in meaning with any other argument.
