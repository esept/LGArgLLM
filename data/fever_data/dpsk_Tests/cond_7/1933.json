Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share a common semantic subset related to the historical and clinical connection between dissociative identity disorder and multiple personality disorder. The first argument mentions the direct connection via the DSM, while the second refers to the interchangeable use in literature. Both contribute to the same support for the claim, so their justifications are not disjoint.
