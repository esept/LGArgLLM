Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument relies on public records, the second on the association of the name 'Konidela' with a well-known family, and the third on interviews or statements from family members. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
