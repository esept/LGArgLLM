Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the lack of shoulders in urban or congested areas, while the second argument addresses temporary elimination of shoulders due to construction or maintenance zones. These are distinct reasons for the absence of shoulders and do not share a common semantic subset.
