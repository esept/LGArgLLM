Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments focus on distinct aspects of Aruba's uniqueness among the ABC Islandsâ€”one on geographical distinctiveness (being outside the hurricane belt) and the other on political status (constituent country vs. special municipalities). These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
