Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument focuses on the director's nationality (British-born, naturalized American), while the second argument focuses on the financing and distribution by American companies. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
