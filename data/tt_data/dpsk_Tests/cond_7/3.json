Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments overlap in their support of the claim. Both argue against the claim by providing evidence that the heart is located on the left side of the chest, not the right. The first argument uses anatomical details (the apex of the heart), while the second cites educational consensus, but both share the same semantic direction of contradicting the claim.
