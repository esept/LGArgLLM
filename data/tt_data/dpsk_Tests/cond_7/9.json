Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset supporting the claim by emphasizing the legal principle that ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. They all reference the inadmissibility of ignorance as a defense, the presumption of knowledge of the law, and the foundational legal maxim 'ignorantia juris non excusat'. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint.
