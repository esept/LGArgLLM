Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their semantic content with respect to the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention the dilution of sodium levels (A1, A2, A4) or the risk to specific groups like athletes (A3, A6). Additionally, several arguments reference medical or clinical evidence (A2, A4, A5, A6), indicating shared semantic subsets that contribute to supporting the claim. Thus, no pair of arguments is fully disjoint.
