Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are not semantically disjoint. They all relate to the principle of legality and the prohibition of ex post facto laws, sharing a common semantic subset that supports the claim. For example, the first argument mentions the principle of legality, the second discusses ex post facto laws, and the third references international human rights instruments protecting against retroactive punishment. These justifications overlap in meaning and collectively support the claim.
