Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments share common semantic subsets that contribute to the support of the claim. For example, multiple arguments mention that tigers are part of the Felidae family (cat family) and that this family is classified under Mammalia, which supports the claim that tigers are mammals. Additionally, several arguments reference mammalian traits such as mammary glands, live birth, and fur, which are overlapping justifications. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
