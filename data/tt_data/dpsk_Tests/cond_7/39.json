Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, as they all refer to the validity of the logical structure (syllogism, universal instantiation, transitive property, etc.) underlying the claim. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
