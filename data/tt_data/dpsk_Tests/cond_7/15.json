Result: false
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic subset related to the arithmetic sequence formed by the ages of Xiaoming, his father, and his grandfather when Xiaoming turns 30. They all discuss the constant difference of 30 years between the ages, which supports the claim. No pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
