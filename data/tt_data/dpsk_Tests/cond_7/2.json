Result: true
Justification: The two arguments' justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first justification focuses on medical guidelines advising against antibiotic use for viral infections due to lack of therapeutic benefit, while the second justification explains the biological mechanismâ€”that antibiotics target bacteria, not viruses, and thus are ineffective against viral infections. These justifications address different aspects of the claim without overlapping in meaning.
