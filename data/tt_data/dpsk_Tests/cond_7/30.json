Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint. The first argument focuses on the general principle that the parity of the sum depends on the count of odd numbers, while the second argument provides a specific counterexample where the sum is odd. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
