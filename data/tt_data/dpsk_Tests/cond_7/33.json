Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that the ages 60, 30, and 0 form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.5. They all refer to the mathematical definition of a geometric sequence and how the given ages satisfy this definition. Therefore, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
