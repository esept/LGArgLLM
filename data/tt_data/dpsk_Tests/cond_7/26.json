Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share the common semantic subset of confirming the validity of the equation 2² + 2² = 8 by demonstrating the correctness of the calculation. The first argument explicitly states the simplification and result, while the second argument confirms the validity by referencing the standard order of operations. Thus, their justifications are not semantically disjoint.
