Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are not semantically disjoint. Both justifications refer to the same basic arithmetic calculation (20 + 10 = 30) to support the claim, albeit with slightly different phrasing. The first justification directly states the arithmetic, while the second refers to the universally accepted method of calculating age, which inherently involves the same arithmetic. Thus, they share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
