Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided overlap in their support of the claim that Paris is the capital of France. They all contribute to the same semantic subset by reinforcing Paris's status as the capital through historical, administrative, legal, and cultural evidence. None of the justifications are disjoint; they all intersect in supporting the claim.
