Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the size comparison between Jupiter and Earth. Each argument's justification reinforces the idea that Jupiter is larger than Earth, using different metrics (diameter, volume, observational data, gravitational measurements). Therefore, no pair of arguments has justifications that are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
