Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. Each argument provides a distinct reason (medical imaging, bone fusion during development, comparative anatomy studies, educational consensus, and forensic science application) that supports the claim without overlapping in meaning. Therefore, at least one pair of arguments has disjoint justifications.
