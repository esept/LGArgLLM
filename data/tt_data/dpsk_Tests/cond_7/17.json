Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments overlap in their support of the claim that Newton and Leibniz jointly discovered calculus. For example, multiple arguments reference the independent development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz (e.g., historical records, publications, and academic consensus). Additionally, the impact of their work (e.g., notation) and the priority dispute are also mentioned in multiple arguments. Thus, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
