Result: false
Justification: All the justifications share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that Earth is a planet in the solar system. Each argument provides different supporting details (e.g., IAU definition, NASA confirmation, astronomical observations, educational curricula, historical records), but they all converge on the same core idea. Therefore, no pair of arguments has disjoint justifications with respect to the claim.
