Result: false
Justification: The justifications of all arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. All arguments revolve around the definition of age being tied to birth order and the linear progression of time since birth. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
