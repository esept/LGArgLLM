Result: false
Justification: All the arguments share a common semantic subset related to the mechanisms and evidence supporting the claim that insulin lowers blood sugar levels. For example, the biological mechanism (glucose uptake by cells, inhibition of gluconeogenesis) and clinical evidence (medical consensus, FDA approval) are overlapping themes across the justifications. Therefore, no pair of arguments is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
