Result: false
Justification: All the justifications for the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim, which is that Paris is the capital of France, not Marseille. They all reference different aspects (official sources, historical records, governmental institutions, educational resources, and diplomatic missions) that confirm Paris as the capital, making them semantically overlapping with respect to the claim.
