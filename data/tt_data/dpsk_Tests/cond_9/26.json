Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments justify the claim by demonstrating that the equation 2² + 2² simplifies to 8 through basic arithmetic operations and adherence to standard mathematical rules (order of operations). The semantic core of both justifications is the correct simplification and validation of the equation.
