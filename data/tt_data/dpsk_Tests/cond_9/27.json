Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 = 18 holds true because it follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), where parentheses are evaluated first, followed by multiplication. This is consistently supported by arithmetic rules, calculator/software validation, textbook algebra, and substitution of values.
