Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first justification focuses on the incorrect implication of interchangeability of operations without parentheses, while the second justification highlights the misrepresentation of the relationship between addition and multiplication. These are distinct points without a shared semantic intersection.
