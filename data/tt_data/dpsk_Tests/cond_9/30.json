Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on the general principle that the parity of the sum depends on the count of odd numbers, while the second argument provides a counterexample showing that the claim fails for a finite set of odd numbers with an odd count. These justifications address different aspects and do not intersect semantically.
