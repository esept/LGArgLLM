Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on the lack of therapeutic benefit of antibiotics for viral infections, while the second argument emphasizes the need for antiviral medications or immune response, highlighting the specificity of antibiotics for bacterial pathogens. Although both oppose the claim, their justifications address different aspects (lack of benefit vs. mechanism mismatch), so there is no shared semantic intersection.
