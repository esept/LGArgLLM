Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim that Donald Trump is German. Instead, they both argue against the claim by stating facts that contradict it (lack of German citizenship and U.S.-rooted career). There is no intersection in meaning that supports the claim.
