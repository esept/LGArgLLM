Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core supporting the claim. The first argument states that Osaka lacks governmental institutions which are in Tokyo, while the second argument mentions that international organizations list Tokyo as the capital. Both justifications actually oppose the claim rather than supporting it, and they do not intersect in a way that supports the claim.
