Result: false  
Justification: The justifications do not share a common semantic core because some arguments incorrectly assert that the sequence 60, 30, 0 is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.5, while others correctly note that the ratio between 30 and 0 is 0, which is not consistent with the definition of a geometric sequence (where the ratio must be non-zero and constant). This inconsistency means there is no shared semantic basis for the claim.
