Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that the ages of Xiaoming, his father, and his grandfather form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 30 when Xiaoming turns 30. Each justification reinforces this by calculating or confirming the consistent age differences, thus collectively supporting the claim.
