Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic core that the prime factorization of 6 (2 Ã— 3) implies that any number divisible by 6 must also be divisible by both 2 and 3. Each argument reinforces this fundamental mathematical principle, either through direct reference to the factorization, divisibility rules, or modular arithmetic.
