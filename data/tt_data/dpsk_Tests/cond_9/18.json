Result: true  
Justification: All justifications share a common semantic core that supports the claim by appealing to fundamental principles (transitive property of inequality, logical deduction), universal validity (no counterexamples, universally accepted), and alignment with human experience and intuition about age and time. Each justification reinforces the same underlying reasoning for the claim.
