Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided all argue against the claim, emphasizing that a person cannot be punished for an act that was legal when committed. They collectively support the opposite semantic basis, focusing on principles like legality, prohibition of ex post facto laws, and legal certainty. There is no common intersection supporting the claim; instead, they uniformly contradict it.
