Result: false  
Justification: The justifications of the arguments do not share a common semantic core. The first argument focuses on the contradiction with universally accepted methods of calculating age, while the second argument emphasizes the consistency of age calculation methods in legal and social systems. Although both arguments oppose the claim, their justifications address different aspects (universal methods vs. legal/social systems) without a shared semantic intersection.
