```
Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the equation misrepresents the relationship between addition and multiplication, violating standard arithmetic rules. The first argument explicitly mentions the incorrect interchangeability of operations without parentheses, while the second highlights the misrepresentation of the operations' relationship. Both justifications converge on the point that the equation fails to adhere to proper arithmetic principles.
