Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the ages of Xiaoming, his father, and his grandfather form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 30 when Xiaoming turns 30. Each justification either calculates the ages, verifies the common difference, or confirms the consistency of the arithmetic sequence, all of which are directly related to the claim.
