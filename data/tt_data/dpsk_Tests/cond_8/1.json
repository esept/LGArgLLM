Justification: All arguments share the common idea that insulin lowers blood sugar levels, either through direct mechanisms (e.g., facilitating glucose uptake by cells, inhibiting gluconeogenesis) or through clinical and regulatory evidence (e.g., medical consensus, FDA approval). Each pair of arguments overlaps in their support for the claim by referencing these shared concepts.
