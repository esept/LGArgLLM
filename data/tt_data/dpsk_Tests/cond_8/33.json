Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the ages 60, 30, and 0 form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.5. Each argument justifies this by referencing the mathematical definition of a geometric sequence, the consistency of the ratio between terms, or the application of the geometric sequence formula. The semantic overlap is clear as all justifications revolve around the same core mathematical reasoning.
