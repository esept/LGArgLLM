Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument discusses the legal principle of double jeopardy, its protections against government overreach, and its recognition in various legal systems or rulings. For example, A1 and A3 both mention protection against government overreach, A2 and A4 both reference legal recognition (Supreme Court rulings and international instruments), and A3 and A4 both emphasize fairness and global acceptance. Thus, every pair has at least one common idea in their justifications.
