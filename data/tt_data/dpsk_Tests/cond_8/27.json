Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the equation (4 + 2) Ã— 3 = 18 is correct due to adherence to the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Each argument reinforces this idea by referencing different aspects (e.g., arithmetic consistency, textbook rules, substitution validation) that all ultimately rely on the same foundational principle of evaluating parentheses first followed by multiplication.
