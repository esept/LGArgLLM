Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Earth is a planet in the solar system, supported by various authoritative sources (e.g., IAU, NASA), observational evidence, and educational consensus. Each justification reinforces this core claim through overlapping reasoning about Earth's planetary characteristics, its position in the solar system, or its recognition by scientific institutions.
