Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common semantic justification that the divisibility by 6 implies divisibility by both 2 and 3 because 6 is the product of 2 and 3. Each argument either explicitly states this or uses a mathematical expression (e.g., 6k = 2 × 3 × k) or a divisibility rule to convey the same idea. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
