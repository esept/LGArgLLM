Justification: The two arguments do not share any overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on Trump's lack of German citizenship or official claims to German nationality, while the second argument discusses the roots of his political career in the United States. There is no common idea, proposition, or reasoning pattern between their justifications.
