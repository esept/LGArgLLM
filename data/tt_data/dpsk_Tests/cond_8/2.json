Result: false
Justification: The two arguments provided do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that medical guidelines advise against using antibiotics for viral infections, while the second argument explains that viral infections require antiviral medications or the immune response, not antibiotics. Although both arguments oppose the claim, their justifications focus on different aspects (guidelines vs. biological mechanisms) and do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern.
