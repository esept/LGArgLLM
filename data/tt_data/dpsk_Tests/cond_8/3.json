Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument focuses on the anatomical orientation of the heart (apex pointing left), while the second argument emphasizes the educational consensus on the heart's left-sided placement. There is no common idea or proposition in their justifications that directly supports the claim about the heart being on the right side.
