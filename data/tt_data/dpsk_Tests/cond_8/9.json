Result: false
Justification: The arguments all oppose the claim by stating that ignorance of the law is not a valid defense, but their justifications do not semantically overlap. The first argument focuses on the principle of public accessibility of laws, the second on the practical consequences for the rule of law, and the third on the legal maxim itself. There is no common idea or proposition shared across all pairs of justifications.
