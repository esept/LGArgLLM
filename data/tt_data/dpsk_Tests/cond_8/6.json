Result: false
Justification: While all arguments support the claim by referencing legal doctrines, principles, or international instruments that prohibit punishing acts that were legal when committed, they do not all share overlapping semantic justifications. For example, the first argument cites the principle of legality, the second mentions ex post facto laws, and the third refers to international human rights instruments. These are distinct justifications that, while related to the claim, do not necessarily overlap in their semantic content. Therefore, not all pairs of arguments share a common idea or reasoning pattern in their justifications.
