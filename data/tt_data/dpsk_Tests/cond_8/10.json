Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that Paris is the capital of France, supported by various aspects such as historical, governmental, international recognition, legal, and economic factors. Each pair of arguments overlaps in their justifications by reinforcing the central claim through different but related perspectives. For example, the historical establishment of Paris as the capital (first argument) aligns with its designation in the French Constitution (fifth argument), and the presence of government institutions (second argument) is consistent with international recognition (third argument). Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
