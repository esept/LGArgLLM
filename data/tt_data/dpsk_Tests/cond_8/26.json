Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that the equation 2² + 2² simplifies to 8, confirming its validity. The first argument directly states this, while the second argument supports it by referencing the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) which leads to the same result. Thus, their justifications overlap semantically in relation to the claim.
