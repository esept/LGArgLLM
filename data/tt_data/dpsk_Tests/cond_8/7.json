Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument refers to the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' as a foundational or operational element in legal systems, supported by references to legal traditions, human rights documents, burden of proof, judicial processes, historical reforms, and modern jurisprudence. The common theme across all justifications is the universal application and importance of this principle in ensuring fair treatment and protecting individual rights.
