Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that the father's age is derived by adding 30 years to the son's age, which is a straightforward arithmetic relationship. Each justification reinforces this core concept, either by explicitly stating the arithmetic operation or by emphasizing the constant age difference over time. Therefore, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
