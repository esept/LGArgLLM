Result: true  
Justification: Both arguments share the semantic core that the sum of odd numbers results in an even number, either through pairing or algebraic proof. The first argument shows this for two odd numbers, while the second extends it to an even number of odd numbers. Both support the claim that the sum of all odd numbers is always even.
