Result: false  
Justification: The justifications provided do not share a common semantic core. The first justification argues that the ages form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.5, while the second justification describes it as a degenerate geometric sequence with a common ratio approaching zero. These are distinct interpretations and do not intersect semantically.
