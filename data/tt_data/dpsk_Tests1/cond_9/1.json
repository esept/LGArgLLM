Result: true  
Justification: All P-type arguments share a common semantic core that insulin facilitates processes (e.g., glucose uptake, glycogen storage, inhibition of gluconeogenesis) which collectively result in lowering blood sugar levels. Each justification supports the claim by detailing different mechanisms or contexts (natural function, therapeutic use, biochemical processes) through which insulin achieves this effect.
