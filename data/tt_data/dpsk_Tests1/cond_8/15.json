Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share the common idea that the initial conditions (Xiaoming born when father is 30 and grandfather is 60) lead to the ages 30, 60, 90 when Xiaoming turns 30, which forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 30. Each argument either directly states this sequence or verifies its mathematical correctness, ensuring semantic overlap in their justifications.
