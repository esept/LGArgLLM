Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share a common semantic justification related to the claim. Each argument's justification revolves around the idea that divisibility by 6 inherently requires divisibility by both 2 and 3, either through the product of 2 and 3, the expression of the number as a multiple of 6, or the prime factorization of 6. This core idea is present in all justifications, ensuring semantic overlap for every pair.
