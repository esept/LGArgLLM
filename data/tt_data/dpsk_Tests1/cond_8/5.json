Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that coercion (or related concepts like duress, undue influence, or lack of voluntariness) invalidates a contract by undermining mutual consent or legal validity. Each justification refers to this core concept, whether through common law principles, statutory provisions, legal doctrines, or court practices. Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
