Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea that tigers are mammals because they belong to the cat family (Felidae), which is classified under Mammalia. Each justification reinforces this central idea, either by referencing biological classification (Felidae, Mammalia, Carnivora) or by mentioning mammalian characteristics (mammary glands, hair). Thus, every pair of arguments has overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim.
