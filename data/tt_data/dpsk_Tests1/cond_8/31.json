Result: true
Justification: All arguments share the common idea of applying basic arithmetic to calculate the father's age based on the given age difference of 30 years. Each justification either directly states the arithmetic calculation (15 + 30 = 45) or refers to the logical consistency and universal acceptance of such calculations, ensuring semantic overlap between all pairs of arguments.
