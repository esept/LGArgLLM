Result: false
Justification: The first two arguments share the idea that cold temperatures are characteristic of winter, but the third argument introduces a different justification based on specific date ranges defining winter. The third argument does not share semantic overlap with the first two regarding the reasoning pattern or proposition about cold temperatures being indicative of winter. Therefore, not all pairs share overlapping semantic justifications.
