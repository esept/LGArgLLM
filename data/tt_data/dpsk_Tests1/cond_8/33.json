Result: false
Justification: The two arguments do not share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. The first argument states that the ages form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.5, while the second argument describes it as a degenerate geometric sequence where the common ratio approaches zero. These are distinct interpretations and do not share a common idea or reasoning pattern.
