Result: true
Justification: All pairs of arguments share overlapping semantic justifications in relation to the claim. Each argument references the principle of 'presumption of innocence' as a fundamental legal or human right, supported by various legal systems or instruments (e.g., U.S. Amendments, Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Additionally, they all emphasize the protection of individuals and fair trials, reinforcing the same core idea.
