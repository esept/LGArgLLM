Result: true
Justification: Both arguments share the common idea that pairs of odd numbers sum to an even number, which supports the claim that the sum of all odd numbers is always even. The first argument explicitly shows this for two odd numbers, while the second generalizes it to an even number of odd numbers. The semantic overlap is clear in their justifications.
