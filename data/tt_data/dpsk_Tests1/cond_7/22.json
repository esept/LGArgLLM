Result: false
Justification: All the justifications provided for the arguments share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim. Each justification provides different aspects (e.g., position from the Sun, IAU classification, gravitational characteristics, scientific consensus) that collectively reinforce the idea that Earth is a planet in the solar system. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
