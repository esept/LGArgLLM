Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument cites historical examples (Nuremberg Trials) to support the claim, while the second argument refers to legal systems allowing retroactive punishment in exceptional cases. These justifications do not share a common semantic subset that contributes to the support of the claim.
