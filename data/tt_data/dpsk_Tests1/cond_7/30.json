Result: true
Justification: The justifications of the two arguments are semantically disjoint with respect to the claim. The first argument justifies the claim by showing that the sum of two odd numbers is even, while the second argument justifies it by showing that the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even. These are distinct justifications that do not share a common semantic subset supporting the claim.
