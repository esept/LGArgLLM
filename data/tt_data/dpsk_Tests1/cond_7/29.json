Result: false
Justification: All justifications share the common semantic subset that divisibility by 6 implies divisibility by both 2 and 3, either through the product of 2 and 3, prime factorization, or rewriting the number in terms of 2 and 3. Thus, no pair of justifications is semantically disjoint with respect to the claim.
