Result: false
Justification: The justifications of the arguments all relate to the claim by discussing the legal and human rights basis of the presumption of innocence, its application in democratic legal systems, and its protective role in fair trials. None of the justifications are semantically disjoint; they all contribute to supporting the claim by overlapping in their focus on the principle's legal foundations and implications.
