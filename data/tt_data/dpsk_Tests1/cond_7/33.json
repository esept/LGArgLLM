Result: false
Justification: Both arguments share the same semantic content in their justifications, as they both discuss the geometric sequence property of the ages (60, 30, 0) and the common ratio (0.5 or approaching zero). Since their justifications overlap in meaning with respect to the claim, they are not semantically disjoint.
